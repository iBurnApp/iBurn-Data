It reminded them of home.\r\n\r\nSoul Brunch isn't just a party; it's like the backyard barbecues of home. It's like the cookouts of yesteryear. As your families invited your communities over, as the generations of soul families invited their communities over, so too does the Heroes & Super Villains family invite the Playa community over to eat together, drink together, get to know one another, dance with each other and uplift each other.\r\n\r\nFrom morning until nightfall, our trained chefs serve up the freshest breakfast burritos on the Playa, accompanied by professionally made craft cocktails. Our collection of international DJs spin smooth beats until nightfall.\r\n\r\nWe also give revelers a chance to clean up with our Soul Power Showers; guests experience the rebirth and rejuvenation of cool, cleansing water sprayed forcefully from our pressurized washer system (imagine a water saving car wash inside our shower areas for guests). Baptized anew, heroes set out on their way spreading positive vibes.\r\n\r\nDJ Lineup:\r\n-Marques Wyatt\r\n-Nicodemus\r\n-Deep Woods\r\n-Sabo\r\n-Rafael de la Cruz",

        "description": "This workshop is about working with the magical, creative energy of Burning Man to create a plan-of-action to bring your unique offering to the world.  When you are holding onto your creative expression, your gifts, your particular genius, or pretending not to know what it is, it's gets very uncomfortable after a while. It will start itching inside of you to be created in physical form, it's deepest desire is to be born out of the dream space. You came to Planet Earth to share this, now is your time. Calling all healers, conversation-starters, rebels, light-workers, and medicine women. This workshop is broken down into four magical sections. \r\n\r\n1) Connection. How relating to others is the number one function of your business or passion project. We begin the workshop with getting connected on the soul level to your fellow sisters.\r\n2) Reclaiming Your Unique Brilliance. Refining your message and creating something in the world that is unique, contributive, and that people will pay for. \r\n3) Healing Your Relationship With Money. Girl, if you want to start or expand your business, you've got to look at your drama and trauma with money. What would it be like if money flowed to you with ease? What would it be like if you could actually receive it? We will dive into this exploration together.\r\n4) Closing Ritual. Our closing ritual will include a beautiful ceremony to hold each others intentions and desires as we go create in the world. You will be let into a \"light-share\" experience.",

The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites.

If you're interested in learning more about how to please a man orally, this is the place for you. . . . . . \r\n\r\nCome on ladies / givers, you know you've got some skills - and some questions!  Come share your favorite tips and techniques by words and demonstration.  If you're still exploring getting comfortable, or are curious about details you never dared ask anyone, come share questions that have been plaguing you. . . . . . \r\n\r\n\t* How to protect yourself when the action gets intense? . . .\r\n\t* What about the gag reflex? . . .\r\n\t* Drool or dry?  . . .\r\n\t* How do you use hands and still go deep? . . .\r\n\r\nAnd guys, you must have comments you'd like to pass on, other than simply \"Yes, please\"! . . . . .\r\n\r\n\t* Hate teeth?  Want teeth? . . .\r\n\t* What about deep throat? . . .\r\n\r\nHere's your chance to make your requests - and pet peeves - heard! . . . . .\r\n\r\nThis is a participatory event open to couples of any combination, so long as one of them has some phallic protuberance and the other is applying lips, tongue, and maybe even throat to it.  No lookie-loos!  That said we also strongly welcome women still getting comfortable with giving oral pleasure, with or without a partner.  This is a really safe place to ask questions, in the group or in private conversation afterwards. . . . . .\r\n\r\nThis was a great fun event at previous Burns.  The presenter's been researching all year to find new tidbits and info to share.  (Hey, someone's gotta do the tough jobs.)  Come show off, learn stuff, and have fun. . . . . .\r\n\r\n(Please bring a towel or sarong to lie on for your comfort.)",

BRSC promises fiber-infused fermented beverages, a Rat-pack soundtrack, and plastic covers on the chairs. It is best to stay regular before heading to the OrgyDome. Schlep yourself out to the DEEP PLAYA and get ready to kibbitz. Come for the hard candy, but stay for the drinks and the continued questioning of \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come and visit your bubbee more?\u201d and \u201cHave you met any nice girls out here in the desert?\u201d. We hope the wax fruit doesn\u2019t melt on the playa, as MOOP isn\u2019t just when you get the Metamucil Out Of the Pantry\u2026",

Now you're wondering, \"What the hell was I thinking?\" Don't leave the playa wishing you hadn't done something, or conversely, wishing you had, but didn't have the communication tools to ask for what you wanted. Communication is sexy, consent is sexy, and good boundaries make all the difference between having a great experience and wishing you could, turn back time. SexPositive World has developed  fun and interesting exercises that help you get in the habit of feeling into what you really want, asking for that, and gently and lovingly saying no when preferable. If you're not sure, we've got great negotiation techniques to teach you how to get to a situation that is a win-win for all concerned. These are skills that will be with you, long after the playa dust settles: you will find yourself using them, not just in areas of sex and relationship, but with your family, friends, and employers too. Class size is limited to 30 participants. Join Gabriella and the other \"sexperts\" and love perveyors at Play4Play and get ready to have the experiences YOU want. Class recommended for women and couples, but good for everyone!",

In brief: we choose a location, sit and write for ten minutes or so, share what we have written, and move on to another location. The only response we give to each others' writing is \"thank you.\" \r\nWe will likely depart from the Midway around 3:50 after we get ourselves organized and sit down to \"write out the cobwebs.\" Participate for as long as you wish. Depending on interest, we may even publish our work online after the event. Visit writingmarathon.com to get a taste of how we do this in the Big Easy!",

Fear sometimes get embedded deep in our psyche and will remain there until and unless we choose to address them.

In this workshop, we will breakthrough our fears by breaking an arrow with our throat as a metaphorical exercise. It can be fear related to us growing up as queer individuals or any other personal fears that gets in our way to becoming our full two-spirit beautiful self.

BURN2 is a great place to decompress, precompress, and self-express your artistic side and your burner personality- all within the boundaries of the principles of Burning Man that you've come to know and love.  All the burn without the real-life dust.  Well, we do have dust storms on our virtual playa sometimes.",

How to be safe on the rails, not get arrested, and enjoy a rugged adventure.   Hitchhiking sucks!   Freight trains don't go everywhere but they can get you far and fast toward your destination.  Having no destination is even better!   Learn what to carry with you, where to ride on a train, and how to keep a low profile.  Also learn how freight trains operate, where they stop, and how to find a 'friendly' railroad worker with whom to communicate.  Familiarize yourself with the 'Do's and Don'ts' of freight train hopping and discover the last shred of what real freedom means in America.",

The Chakraland game is a 22\u00d730 foot vinyl flooring of a multicolored human sized game that participants play by rolling the giant dice and moving towards the different colored squares, each square representing a different chakra. The layout is similar to the child\u2019s game \u201cCandyland\u201d. The squares will all have different quests written on them that need to be completed in a certain timeframe, or players have to go back to the previous square of the same color. There are some short cuts, wild pink squares, and black lose-a-turn squares. The winner makes it to the end of the colored path and gets loved up by the colorful game jesters. Yay, so much fun!",

He's trying to be funny at you.  He's a burlesque.  Or a Bozo.  Or a body comedian.  You can't punch him because that would be wrong.  You can't cry because you're terrified.  And you can't laugh because the life has been sucked out of you.  So you push it down, deep inside.  Where the clown trauma festers in its own silent and pressurized tank of suppressed rage and fear.\r\n\r\nThese incidents have been seen with increasing frequency as clowning has infiltrated our community.  Clowns are easy.  Clowns are anonymous.  Clowns are everywhere.  And clowns are dangerous.  They are the death knell of participation culture, just as the deadbeats were the death knell of hippie culture.  They embody the cheap, the quick, and the easy, and they should not be allowed to take over.\r\n\r\nCome to our shaded bar and snack on our snacks with us.  Learn the story of clowns, past, present, and future.  Drink your health in a clown-free zone.  Crush the red nose of clown oppression.  And embed a new mantra into your soul: \r\n\r\nI will never be clowned again.",

Chanting, dancing and other ritualistic strategies will generate a massive collective energy. No experience necessary!  For the generally creative and outgoing. It manifests a collective spirit as we create a sacred space for transformation and rebirth. Inspiration, identity and rebirth take morphing, sculptural form. The Cocoon is a hand-crafted stretchy fabric enclosure created by Sherry Aliberti, an architect and performance artist based in New York City. Structurally, these postures represent a scale model of an architecture and materiality based on the forces of the body. The Cocoon Project is a multi-disciplinary collaborative performing the Cocoon with movers, live projected visuals and soundscape. The performed-installation conveys a primordial one-ness of many bodies within the sheer membrane. CocoonNYC performs site-specifically in galleries, music venues and alternative spaces. The Cocoon experience can be emotionally powerful for every age and/or background.",

If you have one of these costumes, or want to make one, then get to it! We need you to join us as we dance across the darkness and spread joy throughout the land. Stickman BRC has been illustrating our EL wire childlike magic on the Playa since 2004, bringing art to life. Over the years, we've seen others infuse their creativity into the ranks of Stickhood and we think its time we unite. Nothing sadder than a lonesome Stickman.\r\n\r\nMeet at (6:30/Esplanade) at 9:30pm Tuesday night, September 1st; at 10pm, we venture out to the Playa. We'll be on foot, route tbd, so wear your walkin'/dancin' shoes. We hope you can play with us!\r\n\r\nJoin the FB page (and check the files) for info on how to make one.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/StickmanBRC/events/\r\n\r\nNeed some inspiration?\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEX1PghxkJY\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_xSyoqRY_k&playnext=1&list=PLA7CCE3A2EAC0C945&feature=results_video\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHqiRBeGdkk&feature=relmfu\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=LxyjhofF6Lw&feature=endscreen",

Then it moves you into a deeper state of consciousness and closer to your individual and collective soul\u2019s purpose. Utilizing dance, contemporary shamanism, hands on healing, drumming and global music, this powerful and beautiful soul work sheds inhibitions and heightens inner awareness in a safe and carefully monitored group setting. Dancers are blindfolded in the shamanic tradition and step beyond their conscious fears and limitations and allow their innermost creative sides to break free. Dancers tune in to sound and movement to take an inner journey exploring a trance-like state of self-discovery and self-realization.",

Breath, meditation, and yoga are some of the keys to unlocking the vast treasure that is your sexuality, and in this morning session you will be shown the way.\r\n\r\nThis session is highly recommended for women and for couples, however, no one will be turned away.\r\n\r\nAlex is a full-time yoga teacher in Venice, California. She is a surfer and a total love. Gabriella is a tantric teacher/sex-positive ambassador/and event organizer, who spends her time between Portland and Malibu.",

Come and join us on the Silicon Village stage for a group reading of the funniest and most terrible pieces of fan fiction ever produced... 'The Eye of Argon.\" Bear witness to the near impossible to read dialogue without bursting into laughter as other readers and members of the audience act out the scenes from this story regardless of inconsistencies, spelling errors, grammar errors, capitalization errors, tense errors, and made up words that make no sense! Do you have the stomach for dialogue such as this?\r\n\r\n\"The vile stench of the Shaman's hot fetid breath over came the nauseated female with a deep soul searing sickness, causing her to wrench her head backwards and regurgitate a slimy, orange white stream of swelling gore over the richly woven purple robe of the enthused acolyte.\"\r\n\r\nIf so come to the reading of the \"Eye of Argon\" written 35 years ago and has yet to be forgotten in the sands of time. The dialogue may seem impossible, but the terrible show will go on!",

        "description": "False Profit, Inc., sent shock waves through the stock market with its recent announcement of current plans for its annual Tuesday Night Party (TNP) at The Burning Man Arts and Culture Festival. In a move outside experts are hailing for its boldness and freshtasticness, False Profit, Inc., released news that it would be holding the event not at its desert research field campus proper, but \u201cout in the open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor 14 years, we\u2019ve invited shareholders to our desert campus to celebrate with us,\u201d said Jef Pearlman, Senior VP of Auditory Logistics. \u201cThis year, we decided to think \u2018outside the camp.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nCiting ever-increasing attendance, bicycle parking challenges, and the desire for attendees to experience high fidelity sound \u201cen plein air\u201d as forces pushing the party into the open playa, , a spokesperson for the company enthusiastically predicted that this year\u2019s TNP would be \u201cthe best evar.\u201d\r\n\r\nReferring to the unanticipated relocation, an unnamed insider also hinted that the main research facility is so filled this year with mad science projects--which shareholders will undoubtedly wish to keep a watchful eye on as conditions evolve--that the decision to shift was \u201ceasy peasy\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe party will be held on the open \u201cplaya\u201d approximately 300 feet out from the company\u2019s primary campus location of 5:15 and Esplanade. This location was chosen due to the giant deep sea fish that will be located there, which analysts expect will protect attendees from wandering shirtcockers, newbs, darkwads, those rich people who are destroying Burning Man, and other unsavory characters. Known as Illumacanth, the fish will delight and astound party attendees with its spikes, lights, and fire. Sound for the event will be provided by the legendary Dr. Brainlove, a project of The Phage, a long-time affiliate company and co-conspirator of False Profit.",

From gazing mindlessly out through the window in elementary school classrooms, to blissful meditations, or exploring the universe via medicine journeys as adults, we need to be free to consciously travel out-of-body. We are residents of many dimensions. To function and contribute in the everyday frequencies, we need to be grounded but not limited. If we can achieve even a brief moment of higher consciousness we have the ability to recall the experience, regenerate it via appreciation, and reenter these same spiritual realities using creative imagination. This also means that we can dial our conscious awareness back down in order to focus on the physical world and appreciate its finer aspects. \r\nThis is the life of the \u201chouseholder\u201d who visits the Mountain Temple of higher consciousness and brings its wondrous vibrations into the local village or city as a balanced human being. \r\n\r\nwww.higherselfdiscovery.com",

        "description": "My camp, the Free Photography Zone, has been doing portraits of the participants of Burning Man continuously for the past 19 years.  Each person, or group, is photographed in a studio setting and given an instant print as their tangible reminder of their Burning Man experience.  I then photograph then on medium format black and white film so that, if they wish, they can get prints at a later date.\r\n\r\nThese are not a re-do of your high school yearbook portrait just in Burning Man attire.  I try to give each person enough time to help me make a lasting photograph.  On our gallery walls in our shade structure there are black and white prints ranging in size from 16x20\" to 4x5' that I hope will be of some inspiration to you.  Though I try not to duplicate what I have done in the past they may serve as a jumping off point for our photography session.  Not the easiest thing given the approximately 47,000 black and white negatives done so far.  I have never counted and see no reason to start now.\r\n\r\nI consider the people I photograph as the most important part of any photograph and always try my best to make a photograph that will be of lasting value and interest well beyond the moment of its creation.\r\n\r\nCome, join me, and together we may make something wonderful.  \r\n\r\nI usually begin each day about 10 or 11 AM and continue into the night till I can't keep on my feet any longer.  Weather permitting I'll begin on Sunday August 30th through Saturday September 5th.\r\n\r\nI do look forward to photographing you.",

There are usually other food goodies available, as we see fit and depending on how drunk we got the night before/that morning. We'll also have our famous Hydration Station for those who aren't drinking or for those under 21 (because they can all still eat BACON, right?! Shush, it's a rhetorical question.) . Also revisit the ARE YOU A BLOODY PUSSY OR WHAT? bar, and see how hot you can take it when Gemini pours whatever the hell she damn well feels like into a shot glass for you to drink. Want to earn YOUR red wings?! Have a seat in our living room, dance the morning away in Tiny Club, play on the trampoline (clothing optional, of course!), or write in the shared journal!

If a participant doesn't have something, we'll provide a gift of their choosing. Then using a trade-loop algorithm a web of exchanged items is created that pairs participants with gifts they want.  For those who only wish to give, we photograph them and give their item's recipient their photo/information to potentially interact with later. \r\n\r\nAll exchanges/kisses are executed daily at noon. Please come before or after to browse/list or join in the chaos of the exchange!",

        "description": "The art performance by Japanese contemporary artist, Ken Hamazaki.  This performance was inspired by and arranged from the Japanese traditional tea ceremony. I named myself Hechi-Ken after the legendary master of tea ceremony, Hechi-Kan. The original ceremony consists of a variety of manners to drink, but to experience this fully, please simply drink with a style you favor most. The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if we could find any great idea to make better and more enjoyable future throughout this tea ceremony.",

Don't offer him a beer, he hates that too. \r\n\r\nHotshot was born Friday during the 2004 burn near the 3:00 plaza.\r\n\r\nIt is with heavy heart he returns to the place of his birth after a nasty bout of losing himself in a search of fame and fortune. \r\n\r\nIt was only after locking on to his self-reflection in a pool in the Hollywood hills, high on some kinda smack did he see what he had become. It was one of those infinity pools that seems like it falls away to the surrounding landscapes. They got really trendy in the middle to late 90's and this one in particular had really nice cultured stone placed to look completely natural almost...\r\n\r\nA pool of robo-flection, falling away to nowhere...in this case it happened to be the gorgeous smog filled sky overlooking the 405 south and the 101. \r\n\r\n\"What have I become?\" he whispers to himself whispering back at himself.  \r\n\"Why am I wearing this amazing floral print burgundy kimono robe?\" which was actually made for him personally by one of the finest seamstresses in the Sai Kung district of Hong Kong. \r\n\r\nHe had been had by himself having been had. \r\n\r\nNo more. It was time to get back to what mattered most in Hotshot's life. I mean after all, no skeezer in all of Orange County could tighten his nuts half as much as The Burn had in the past. Just because he doesn't have feelings, doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings. \r\n\r\nThere is no shame in going.........home. \r\n\r\nHotshot immediately logged onto his brand new Macbook Pro with the 13.3\" HD Retina screen and made his first steps towards the playa and logged onto Stubhub and bought a ticket for $1175.00. After his friends said he couldn't fit his bean bag chair in their ride he went to ebay and purchased a car pass for $389 (free shipping) and folks the rest they say is history. \r\n\r\nCome say hello old friends and new friends alike. 3:00 plaza all week, only God knows when.",

Beer Pong is a possibility if our moop management plans pan out. Food will include your backyard staples- hotdogs, lamb skewers, corn on the cob, and various other items.\r\n\r\nThe bar will, of course, be open.

No bodywork experience is required.\r\n\r\nThai Massage is an ancient bodywork practice which combines acupressure, energy meridian stimulation and yoga-like stretching. This is an Ayurvedic version of Shiatsu which encourages great relaxation and rejuvenation. The recipient, fully clothed on a floor mat, continues to remain passive, while gently and fluidly, yoga-influenced stretches are applied to them. There are many positive effects including stress-reduction, increased flexibility resulting in injury prevention, muscle spasm relief and the treatment of a wide variety of orthopedic complaints. This work is also a conscious, meditational application of Metta (love and compassion) that leaves both the giver and receiver with a life-affirming feeling of peace and connection.\r\n\r\nJennifer Gillmor is a Senior Practitioner at Thai Massage Toronto, a Holistic Table Massage Practitioner and a Yoga Teacher at Yogaspace in Toronto, Canada",

Part of the explanation will be on why this is NOT a martial art and why, despite what you've seen in the movies, no one in their right mind would ever throw a knife at a person. It should be thought of as more of a form of object manipulation, like juggling.\r\n  We'll have one knife throwing wall and a number of floor boards for familiarizing yourself with the weight and balance of the knives. We'll have knives for practice but feel free to bring your own. Classes are Tuesday and Thursday 10:00 - 12:00",

For those trekking across the barren wasteland, evading the dozen or so security and law enforcement agencies, avoiding detection by radar and heat sensors, struggling to finally reach the perimeter fence; our Bar is there to offer you an ice cold beverage and welcome you Home with a hug, brother/sister, before contacting the proper authorities and turning you over to security.\r\n\r\nFor several years I have rode my bicycle with trailer out to the furthest point in Black Rock City with all the booze, juice, water, soda and ice I could fit in the 3 large ice-chests. I purposely set up at the remotest spot I can find, away from camps, sound systems, art vehicles and crowds.  Trying to provide a service to intrepid playa explorers, people out riding bikes along the trash fence, those reaching beyond the EDM to see the desert vastness. As they spot our stack of coolers along the fence, in they trickle and find Iced Cold Margaritas waiting for them. Every year we go through every drop of beverage we can carry out there, usually in under an hour or two. Hosted by Camp Threat.\r\n\r\nBring a cup and witty banter. Join us at the fence.\r\n\r\nAnd, YES, most definitely, Daft Punk will be playing.",

Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It\u2019s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

Includes 2-hour physical practice of Qigong & Yoga that will prepare you for the burn.\r\n\r\nThere will be an explanation of Traditional Indian Medicine (Yoga/Ayurveda) and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Qi Gong/Taoism), two ancient healing systems over 2000 years old. There will be an exploration on the difference between the Indian Hinduism (Polytheistic) & Chinese Taoism (Monotheistic) theories and how we can integrate these two philosophies into our daily spiritual practice to empower ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe discussion will then be followed by a 2 hour Yoga & Qi Gong class which will blend together the elements of ancient India (Yoga) and China (Qi Gong) to provide a dynamic moving meditation focused on providing a balance of both Yang (active) and Yin (passive) elements, that will conclude with a healing Yoga Nidra (conscious deep sleep) meditation - leaving you empowered, focused, and energized - ready for the burn and the new year. \"",

Bring your water or hydration liquid. We\u2019ll provide sticks for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese.

(Like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, moved to Southern California, and taught classes of students and future teachers. Today, weekly classes abound in So Cal, around the US, and the world.

Emily is the hero of the story, a character very much a literary stand-in for author and performer Eleanor O\u2019Brien. We meet her as a child, fascinated by romance novels and her father\u2019s porn. The show traces her journey from awkward teen to college boyfriends, complete with disappointing first times and disastrous blowjobs. But then she discovers renown sex-columnist Dan Savage, her \u2018gay fairy godfather\u2019. Dan helps her learn to ask for what she wants (\u201cI can touch my own clit during sex?\u201d), and encourages her to be GGG (Good, Giving and Game). Emily goes on a spree of experimentation, culminating in the \u201cgrand prix of getting lucky,\u201d Burning Man. At the world\u2019s largest alternative event, she meets Matt, who turns out to be the love of her life-but he doesn\u2019t identify as monogamous. Can they make it work? Emily asks Dan for advice as they navigate the thrills and valleys of opening the relationship: how to negotiate boundaries, deal with jealousy and keep from falling in love with other people. She thinks if they follow the rules they've set, they can keep their relationship safe. They can be \u201cmonogamish,\u201d and keep the spark in their marriage. When a magical threesome drives her to utter meltdown, Emily insists on closing their marriage. But monogamy doesn\u2019t solve all their problems. Emily and Matt discover they have different libidos - and the seven-year itch isn\u2019t a myth. He encourages her to spread her wings, so she takes a lover. All's fine for a while, but soon she finds herself falling in love with Michael, her NSA partner for play. She is terrified of losing her marriage to Matt, and asks Dan again for advice. \u201cIs polyamory a utopian ideal?\u201d During an ayahuasca ceremony, Emily finally sees where she's been blind to how her behavior has stifled her marriage, and how she has to let go of the need for certainty, or controlling anyone else\u2019s heart.",

Mead is the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man & we aim to share with you how easy it is to make at home. A honey based wine, mead requires a very small investment on your part. The variations of style are endless as you can make mead with fruit, ciders, herbs, different kinds of honey, dry or sweet, (i.e. has remaining sugar),  bubbly, (like sparkling wine), or still. We will explain how to make it, where to get it, and even have demo equipment available. 21+ and over can sample different varieties we've made and brought to share. You will come away with an understanding of:   Early Discoveries of Mead,  Mead in Religion and Culture, & the Techniques of Making Mead: -Overall concepts that mixing water, honey and yeast starts a reaction to convert the sugars in the honey to alcohol and release carbon dioxide gas. -The equipment needed such as a 1, 3 or 5 gallon water bottles, airlocks, tubes to siphon off the mead from the \u2018lees,\u2019 (sediment at the bottom of the fermentation container), bottles, and a few other items such as cleanser to keep everything clean. -Selections of honey to make mead and how the type of honey influences the end result flavor and the same for yeast selection. -Selections of \u2018adjuncts\u2019 which influence the flavor of your mead: the addition of spices such as cloves or cinnamon (known as metheglin), or the addition of fruits such as raspberries or strawberry (melomel).  We will finish up with tasting different styles! Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!",

Johnny was an integral member of the New York City Burning Man community and a loving \"playa mama\" to his campmates at Love Potion and Duck & Cover. We plan to toast him with a Happy Hour at Love Potion, then migrate to The Man, where some of his ashes will be in The Man's heart. From there, we will erect our memorial to him in The Temple and, finally, travel to deep playa to scatter his ashes at sunset. It will be festive and filled with joy, just as Johnny was. For us, it will be as if he is joining us on the playa one more time! Bring bikes and booze!",

I have 18 years coaching authentic self-expression, including 4 TEDx talks. 22 years studying people / human interaction via songwriting (and expressing my findings artfully). 28 years as a performer in various capacities, especially singing. In my career I've presented music and talks for over 100,000 people. Also, I've spent the last full year doing a deep dive into femininity/polarity studies. I am an advocate for men being empowered (especially as women claim their power more and more), and attaining the capacity to leave legacies. This includes knowing how to navigate matters of the heart. Overall, I really LOVE showing men how to feel happy and free professionally, publicly, and personally by learning how to express themselves authentically. So much of this revolves around a man's ability to limit drama and distraction in his life.",

Each session would include an intention of focus that I would explain before beginning. What is more than being present? Presence itself.",

We'll sense and feel the way that energy moves through the body with Qi Gong practice. We'll explore somatic training and the Body/Mind practices of Developmental Movement and Experiential Anatomy. We'll investigate our relationship to form, space, and each other through Viewpoints Space Awareness and Mudra Space Awareness. \r\n\r\nThis class is a laboratory where we'll be working with the energy that animates our bodies. We'll be exploring how energy moves when the body moves and how mind can direct energy. We'll learn to harness the power of the breath and focus of the mind to attain higher performance outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe work is toward attaining a greater depth of expression of personal energy, achieving grace and ease in a variety of movement patterns, developing an equanimity of all body parts as initiators and supporters of movement in space, and gaining the ability to dance ecstatically with great amounts of energy without loss of awareness of where you are and what is around you. \r\n\r\nEveryone is welcome from dancers seeking to bring contemplation into their dance - to those wishing to bridge their sitting practice to their walking meditation practice to the rest of their active lives - to people who have never danced or meditated before.",

To be naked in 21st century western society demands intense self-examination, the questioning and reappraisal of conventional conventions and morality. In this sense, naturism, as the cultural and political movement of nudism is often known, is an inherently philosophical practice. \r\n\r\nAnd what better way to do philosophy than naked? We\u2019re sure your college seminars would have been much more fun nude.\r\n\r\nCome and join us for lively discussions, debates and story-telling. We\u2019ll be discussing naturism, body image, sharing experiences, debating body modification, if and how laws should be changed \u2013 really everything related to the human body.",

You\u2019re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It\u2019s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you\u2019ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we\u2019re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we\u2019re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your \u201cfuck yes!\u201d and your \u201cOh no!\u201d and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don\u2019t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!",

Some of the movements we do induce mutual trance states by using repetitive circular motion. A hug that evolves into a spiral that is so safe and supported that we enter graceful states of consciousness. If you are looking for ways to enhance your relationship with your partner, this may be useful. Relating in non-verbal, non-linear fashion can have an effect of breaking through barriers of relating on new and different levels.

This annual event features music, libations and snacks and is a great place to reconnect with friends and/or a hottie from the past---or even a new hottie for 2015---right at the beginning of the week.

We offer an outdoor play area, a covered open area, and new to our camp, an enclosed area offering privacy out of sight from passerbyers. We invite everyone but especially beginners and those curious about BDSM play to come and play in a safe, non-pressured, and supervised environment to learn and experience dungeon play. As our name implies (Playfully Yours), we focus on the lighter, more sensual, and playful side of BDSM. The dungeon is well equipped with 3 St Andrews Crosses, a seated cross, 2 benches, a kneeling spanking/flogging bench, a standing spanking/flogging bench, a suspension station, 2 padded saw horses, a standing/kneeling stock, an 8' chain spider web, and a petting cage. We offer several toys to come and experience and play with such as feathers, a variety of floggers, paddles, crops, pinwheels, fur gloves, and a violet wand. Our personnel are available to provide instruction and demonstration on the safe use of the equipment and will supervise all play. We also have a lounge area where you can relax and meet our campmates while checking out our camp. The lounge has a spanking bike, a corn hole bean bag game, lounge chairs, a mini bar serving our cherry bombs for those over 21 years old with id, as well as, a spinning wheel to facilitate participation.  There are also daily scheduled classes with demonstrations and audience participation. We'll have an Intro Into Dungeon Play and a Shibari Sexy Body Rope Tying classes. We also have gifting of collars, paddles and patches. Our hours accommodate those coming in an play both day and night, generally from noon to about 3 am.",

Most people spend a good deal of energy trying to ignore the images that flood their internal screens, clutter their minds and stir up their emotions. But throughout the ages, there will always be creative people who practice opening the third eye in order to see into the depths of this world and to explore other dimensions. Craig will teach powerful ways of opening up one's awareness to higher vision to receive insight and to shine with healing light.\r\nThis workshop will offer practical techniques for developing an enhanced ability to see psychically while being supported by intuitive sensing, the inner voice, and sensory feelings for verification. You will also learn methods for seeing energy, viewing facial changes that reveal past lives, perceiving spiritual beings, and gazing into a portal to higher dimensions - all with your eyes wide open. \r\n\r\nwww.higherselfdiscovery.com",

The default model for relationship in our society, monogamy, makes explicit the underlying belief that Freedom and Love exist in opposition with each other.\r\n\r\nBut what if our desire for Freedom in relationship is covering a deeper desire, namely that we want to know, and be assured, that we can speak and honor our deepest Truths, and Desires, even, and especially, while in we are in Loving committed partnerships. So what if, instead of talking about Freedom, we talked how to create a relationship where it's safe to speak our Truths, including all of our desires (even for others), and know that we will still be Loved?\r\n\r\nJoin us for a conversation about how open relationships can be created from a place deep Love and commitment to Truth.",

We then dispense our \"Tiki Punch\" (yes, it has a punch) well into the night. Nudity is never required but at Party Naked Tiki Bar it is rewarded. This year we have 1800+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that \"do it\" (get naked). Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited touching is prohibited. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day.

Or Neither. \r\n\r\nSeveral Riders PEDAL AND DRIVE head-to-head around a 60 x 90 foot track under the gorgeous CIRCUS TENT with LIGHTS, MUSIC and ANNOUNCERS! Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT!\r\n\r\n Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races!\r\n\r\nPEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. \r\n\r\nWe also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa!",

This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. \r\n\r\nUnder the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject.\r\n\r\nWe maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa.\r\n\r\nThe pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999. The pinhole came about of the desire of four first time participants to contribute in a unique and lasting way to the ephemeral pleasures of the playa.\r\n\r\nAs we have grown, so too has our belief that this device is the reason that we make our annual pilgrimage. As we have evolved, so too has the camera, not only in functional and technical capabilities but also in its role as a seed of meaningful engagement with other participants.",

There is much wisdom in the poly community which can be helpful to people trying to make *any* relationship work, monogamous or Polyamorous. There will be a facilitated discussion in which you can get your questions addressed and some of the knowledge in our community can be shared.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to cool off and de-dust yourself after our tea party, bring a water donation to enjoy PolyParadise's famous Human Carcass Wash.",

Maybe it was a branch of a tree with a piece of tinsel wrapped around it? Possibly you\u2019ve been mesmerized by one of those floating jellyfish on Burn Night?\r\n\r\nWell \u2013 if the jellyfish is your thing then you probably need to come back for the advanced class next year. But random objects hanging from sticks covered in lights and glittery things\u2026 that\u2019s totally our thing! That, my friend, is what we call a \u201craving stick\u201d and no self-respecting raver should venture out onto the playa at night without one.\r\n\r\nCome for an interactive, playa punch-infused lesson in the art of raving stick making, featuring group discussions and plenty of one on one time with our experienced teachers. We\u2019ll round off the afternoon with a delightful presentation on the history of the raving stick - you simply won\u2019t believe some of the famous names you\u2019ll hear!\r\n\r\nRaving stick materials will be provided on the day by Celtic Chaos, but attendees are more than welcome to bring along their own personal additions. And the best part is that each person gets to leave with the raving stick that they make... but not until they partake in a collective stick-shaking rave-off inside The Castle!",

Do you want to reduce the amount of recycling you will have to pack out? Start by bringing all of your beverages in aluminum cans. Follow that by separating your your aluminum cans and other recyclables from any landfill trash. Bring your aluminum cans to Black Rock City Recycle Camp. We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is \"Open\" and ready to accept your aluminum cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. You can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and Black Rock City..!!!",

Several Riders PEDAL AND DRIVE head-to-head around a 60 x 90 foot track under the gorgeous CIRCUS TENT with LIGHTS, MUSIC and ANNOUNCERS! Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT! Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races! PEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. We also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa! GUEST HOST CREWS SCHEDULED: GATE  CREW is Representing on Tuesday night. MYSTIKAL MISFITS are representing on Wednesday night!",

This process will be facilitated with some simple relating exercises and is a chance to see through our ego and conditioned habitual ways of relating and being. We invite a sense of humor to simply seeing ourselves and the conscious and unconscious games we play. \r\nBringing awareness to our patterns opens the possibility of playing with them and responding from our clear deep heart mind space, rather than reacting. Respond from awareness rather than react from habits. We live from our true nature rather than our conditioning. We dance.",

        "description": "\"What is Rootism?\" My response to this in short: Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs. These truths are different for everyone based on how they we raised and what we resonate with at the time of our learning. As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.\r\n\r\nRootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.\r\n\r\nAs an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.\r\n\r\nThe 8 Principles of Rootism:\r\n\r\n\u221ePrinciples of Rootism\u2122\r\n\r\n1. Release what no longer serves - nurture yourself & ground yourself\r\n2. Embrace a Creative Vision\r\n3. Move forward on your journey -Take Steps Fearlessly\r\n4. Empathize and Feel what is going on within you & others\r\n5. Motivate yourself & others by Truth \u2013 Check the Ecology of the Whole\r\n6. Bridge the Mind & the Heart\r\n7. Evolve a Pro-Sociality Lifestyle & Manifest a Greater Humanity - help others and give back\r\n8. Revolutionize - Reveal Yourself! Open UP! Inner Knowing is Outer Showing\r\n\r\nThe acronym is \"Remember\"",

        "description": "The Butterfly is a high-vibrant, spiritual creation. It is sensitive to its surrounding and is vibrating in the same wavelength as the particles of niverse, as well as the life on earth. It lives in symbiosis with nature, mostly in flowers, becoming one with the Beauty All Around. The Butterfly symbolizes the Universal Spiritual knowledge and deep Wisdom, and creates its life in the perfect alignment of non-attachment, in a dance of flow and Ease. It has a life filled of transformation, from the day of birth until re-birth, between stages, outer and inner form, with ease and grace moving further, without attaching to its old shape, heart wide open for the life in front of Her. This Yogic Journey is dedicated for you to connect with YOUR inner Butterfly, through a travel of transformation, through your body and senses. Bring a Mat (if you have), soft clothing, yourself, as the beautiful and whole being you are.",

(yes that pot of gold we are looking for at the end of those playa rainbows!) In this space of curiosity, experimentation and practice, YOU WILL LEARN the emerging art of SUBTLE COMMUNICATION. You will be able to describe your month in Bali in seven (7) words or less in a way that creates more understanding, more curiosity and, yes, more intimate connection (every time) than your 90 minute slide show and endless stories. Really... \r\nAnswer the tiresome question \"How are you?\" in three (3) words that will say more, build immediate trust and help you to purge more friends on facebook than ever before! We all have the ability to 'know' more without using the left side of our brain. We just aren't so practiced. So, with a bit of science, a measure of technique, the willingness to try a 'different way' and a whole workshop of practice! we will be ready to immediately upgrade any relationship, including the one with the hottie you will meet tonight outside the Pleasure Dome!

We will bring something to identify the \"meat\" and identify Trustable Slut Members.\r\n\r\n# 1 rule of SWAP Meat is\r\nyou bring someone AWESOME\r\nto SWAP Meat.\r\n\r\nWe want to be introduced to more amazing people who want to meet fun, playful, and open women, who are in alignment with our values.\r\n\r\nBring someone who you would recommend to date your best friend. Bring someone who is \"available\" to date. Bring someone who has good boundaries and knows how to communicate. Bring someone who YOU are 100% okay with sharing.\r\n\r\nWho NOT to bring:\r\n-Some random person off the playa\r\n-Someone who is overly eager to hook-up (aka desperate).\r\n-Someone who isn't emotionally available or at least self-aware.\r\n\r\nOfficial Meat Policy:\r\n\r\n1) Meat can be of any gender.\r\n2) We encourage \"available\" meat. That word has many interpretations...it is whatever it means to you. However, here are some ways it means to us:\r\n+ is single or in an open relationship.\r\n+ their relationship agreements allow for dating.\r\n+ has time to date, meaning not just interested in hooking-up.\r\n+ has experience in our or some other community of sexy tribe.\r\n+ has emotional intelligence and communication skills.\r\n\r\n*NOTE: We are open to all gender orientations and sexual orientations. We are LGBTQ friendly.",

It\u2019s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who\u2019s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nLearn how to harness the dual feminine forms and dual masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone.  For Men and Women who want to bring their full spiritual presence into the material world and be the bridge between our present reality and the future vision only you can see.\"",

Is it ever really simple?  \u201cThe Game\u201d requires a high degree of interactivity among all those involved, even those walking by may become drawn into the action and be participants. \u201cThe Game\u201d has a tendency to create possibilities where there were once boundaries.  Choices where there were once obstacles.  \u201cThe Game\u201d: the love child of truth or dare, charades, post office, twister, spin the bottle, and American's Got talent.. \r\n\u201cThe Game\u201d is perfect for letting that INNER freak come out. Watch what happens when permission is given to the darker, more playful side of one's self. That part that stays just out of sight, watching from the sideline, wanting to take part, but doesn't due to social constraint or peer reprisal.\r\n\u201cThe Game\u201d is both a game of chance and boundaries.  Winning is all a matter of perspective. Everyone wins with the upside of personal insight, everyone loses what may have been a self-limiting perspective.  A new episode with each draw is guaranteed to amaze and astound!",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator.  When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience.  Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want.  No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options.  We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave.  We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun.  Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience.  Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense.  If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

        "description": "There are many things you 'could' do, but there's nothing you 'should' do. I suspect there's no such thing as a 'should'. A should is a 'could' with shame smuggled on top of it. Come explore shame and its cousins: guilt, envy, anger and jealousy. All these emotions have one thing in common, they usually hide their tracks and are hard to admit. Learn to transcend your shame with cutting edge subjective tools. We'll investigate the nature of shame & shaming, look at the adaptive advantages of them and how they serve & do not serve our development.\r\n\r\nJoin love coach Annie Lalla for some powerful exercises that will help you move beyond past shames and show you how desist from laying down new ones. This is a forum to discuss how to experience our emotions, especially the difficult ones, so they stop haunting your psyche.  You will leave shameless or at least shamelessly.",

You\u2019re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It\u2019s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you\u2019ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we\u2019re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we\u2019re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your \u201cfuck yes!\u201d and your \u201cOh no!\u201d and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don\u2019t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!",

Are you over people asking why your body looks the way it does? Are you interested in creating real safe spaces for people whether they fit in the binary or not? Are you troubled by cultural appropriation on playa and the way some folks are treated as other or freaks in a way that doesn't feel good? Then this workshop is for you. This workshop is also for you if you want to delve into the intersections of race, gender, class and how these identities affect our experience at BM and beyond. Many of us come to playa to be free and our full liberated selves yet when we pass through the gate we have not dropped our baggage of racism, transphobia, sexism, abelism, and classism at the gate.  So let's be real and talk about how these isms affect our time on playa and off and what we want to do to create the world we want to live in. This workshop will be interactive, engaging, fun, and educational. Let's define what we want the word freakshow to me and let's reclaim ourselves and whole people who all deserve respect.",

However, this isn\u2019t a one-time cheerleading session, but rather an introduction to a simple yet revolutionary way of thinking about things that people can take with them.

        "description": "The Zendo is a community outreach project at Burning Man that offers education and psychological support, with the goal to help reduce the potential harms involved in drug use. Volunteers provide peer-to-peer harm reduction support for individuals having a difficult drug-related experience and who don't require medical care. Guests are sometimes actively on substance, and other times are seeking integration support, or education about the risks involved in drug use. We staff the space 24/7 with trained mental health and medical professionals who provide oversight, as well as individuals experienced in crisis response.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to come to the training to learn more about volunteering, it will take place at Something Freaky This Way Foams, near 2:00&G, on Tuesday September 1 at 11AM. \r\n\r\nThe four principles of psychedelic harm reduction include: \r\n\r\n1. Create a safe space - If someone is having a challenging experience try to move them into a comfortable, warm, and calm environment. If possible, try to avoid noisy or crowded spaces. Ask what would make them most comfortable. Offer blankets and water. \r\n\r\n2. Sitting, not guiding - Be a calm presence of acceptance, compassion, and caring. Promote feelings of trust and security. Let the person's unfolding experience be the guide. Don't try to get ahead of their process. Explore distressing issues if they want, but know that simply being with the person is supportive and talking may not be helpful.\r\n\r\n3. Talk through, not down - Invite the person to explore what's happening and encourage them to try not to resist it. Remind them that they are safe. \r\n\r\n4. Difficult is not the same as bad - challenging experiences can wind up being our most valuable and lead to learning and growth. Help the person integrate the experience, and remind them the experience will continue to unfold.",
