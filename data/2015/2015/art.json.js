In the center (the heart of the heart), dwells a geometric jungle gym, that rotates under human power, while the 3-tier base supports the structure with minimal \r\nimpact to the Playa (no holes!). METAHEART is about discovery. Exploration reveals different aspects of the geometry, as the shape appears to change depending on \r\nthe viewpoint. Interaction brings the sculpture to life, as its sub-powered heartbeat keeps pace with its rotating centerpiece. At night there is more to discovered.Computer-driven LEDs pulsate to the beat, and 3 red lasers, each at a 33 degree angle atop the sculpture, sweep in synchronization. A next level of audio-reactive \r\nlight shows is unlocked only by the proximity of a sufficiently loud art car.",

Have fun interacting with a large scale art piece and make a memory to take with you! \r\n\r\nThe interactivity inside is designed to be discovered. Solar powered, touch sensitive pads will be placed throughout the frame. As people interact with the frame, the sound and lighting activate, encouraging contact, imagination and exploration. \r\n\r\nThis piece is in honor of my Abuela, Rosamelia, and is an opportunity to acknowledge the incredible support that I am so grateful to have had growing up and to pass it on. To inspire self expression, to call up the performer, the artist, the brown sheep and the nut. I imagine the joy that will happen as a result of Got Framed to be a mirror of her gifts to us.",

Participants will be able to spot the installation from far away as a bright glimmering light and as they make their trek out to deep playa the maze will begin to materialize out of thin air & suddenly they will be confronted with with a dazzling house of lights. This Maze of wonders will be a treat to the eyes, the color combinations and depth the lit up walkways, helium balloons and the 20'x20' back-lit centerpiece theater are sure to amaze carnival goers! The theater in the center will be showcasing a fine selection of classic era carnival flicks along with a random dash of psychedelic projections. But before being able to rest to watch a flick with their burner buddies or bunnies House of light attendees must first decipher their way into the center piece and it will be not be an easy feat for those who lack the patience..",

Based on sketches of Cyrotidea drawn in 1904 by German biologist Ernst Haeckel, Zooplankton is an interactive art installation that beckons visitors inside to experience art and science together. By day visitors can enjoy the biological art of Ernst Haeckel etched into the walls of the Zooplankton. Workshops and lectures will turn Zooplankton into a scientific classroom. By night the Zooplankton will charm visitors with its dazzling bioluminescence, triggered by body heat of those who venture inside.",

The swirling colors and sounds of the playa just beyond the colorful paths and flags of the labyrinth make a backdrop for the fascinating panoply of creativity on the playa. Within the labyrinth, participants find a calm center, a space for musing and meditation, or a peaceful moment of At-Onement. In a magical box at the base of a large Cleu, participants may find a clue to their own lives or even be led to CleuCamp where they can get a Cleu brainwashing and copper Cleu pendant. Like the rube at a carnival, Include the Cleu simply offers a fresh perspective, inspiring wonder and delight.",

While felt acutely in Alaska and the Arctic, changing water resources will affect the global community. As researchers, scientists and artists flock to the North, we look to the South, seeking to expand this dialogue in the unlikely yet poignant location of the Black Rock Dessert. Beach Front is an interactive light installation inspired by the role of water in a rapidly changing global climate. A suspended canopy of lights that mimic a sheet of water, Beach Front encourages participation from viewers and natural elements like wind, examining the interdependence between humans and natural forces. Each human-generated ripple illustrates our influence on the rapidly changing water that surrounds us; conversely, able to function solely on wind input, Beach Front acknowledges nature\u2019s ultimate autonomy and self-regulation.",

The base of the tree is an 8ft diameter circle, plasma cut by hand to form the tree's root system.  At the base of the tree trunk sits a children's toy piano which has 25 keys with the bell chimes tuned to the corresponding notes.  The keyboard is midi controlled with wiring that goes through the trunk and limbs that powers a solenoid to strike the bell chime, as well as powers on an LED light rod parallel to the chime that fades as the chime sound fades.  The toy piano has an led strip that illuminates the keys at night.  The base is also backlit by leds which light up when the notes are played.",

So people will have to come together, and support each other getting up and down. The stage like situation invites burners to interact and play with the environment, slip into the role of a child or a lilliput and with their own body, experience a different concept of size. In the presence of the giant table and chairs, the viewer will feel physically diminished and will be returned to the experiences of childhood adventure.\r\nThe sensation of being thrown off balance by the striking discrepancies in the scale of this setting is an invitation for people to think about  existing structures in the default world",

Electronic circuitry, motion sensor lighting, audio, flame effects, and post-apocalyptic elements combine to immerse the participant in a sensory experience that is unsettling and invokes primal urges.  The majority of participants will experience the project by simply passing it by; deeper levels of interaction will be experienced by those who choose to interact physically with the piece.  The viewer can choose to interact with the piece physically\u2026or simply take the social cues and avoid the more interactive elements; this choice replicates the everyday choices we make in our social interactions, causing the viewer to rethink how they interpret the boundaries that are frequently crossed in our lives.",

        "description": "The Dode Project is the collaborative effort of artists exploring the possibilities of repeating patterns.  Geometric structures and repeating patterns are the building blocks  everything in life, from our grided city to our DNA, and can be used to create things in any degree of complexity.  Keeping in tune with the Burning Man theme of appreciating life and radical self-reliance the Dode Project came to being.  This sculpture stands just over 11' tall and is made entirely out of wood.  It is supported by multiple wooden connectors that keep the structure standing with interlocking joints and tension.  The sole use of wood and connectors that hold the structure together is the visual representation of using what is present in front of you efficiently.",

The surface will reflect back to us the tree of life as the restful ancient and the spirit tree amongst the stars.  Nestled within its branches many butterflies will rest in spherical clusters which will protrude from the surface and break free from the edges of the monolith.  At night the orbs will glow in changes of color and later glow under black lights.   On the butterflies wings will be one of four phrases: Love Each other  * Help Each other  *  Inspire Each other   *   Forgive Each other\r\nParticipants within and without the community will have been invited to collaborate by making and bringing the butterfly components to be installed in addition to the artist made components.  Other participants will have been invited to take a butterfly, carry it back to their community and on Sept 21 they will install their butterfly within their community or gift it to an individual.",

When in motion, it gives us a sensorial illusion that messes up with our labyrinth making each experience personal and unique.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the installation is to face the unexpected, its about recreating itself through the presence of each interaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cMangueira\u201d challenges us through sensorial illusions where you don\u2019t expect much when you see it, but everything changes when you experience it. Its and individual or collective journey, you are free to chose.",

Like the manta ray does at the pass, fixing itself in space and time, it replenishes itself as it faces the current. A divider between the worlds of the lagoon and the ocean, the reef pass is where all spirits meet.\r\n\r\nAt night, from the distance, a massive ray floats in mid air, lighting the surrounding area with its glow. The art takes life in an array of color with bright fish swinging in the wind. The spirits are well alive and a symbol of transition between worlds, the Manta guides you through the night.",

The cameras themselves do not work - they were heading for a landfill.  Friends adopted some of them and their point of creative view adds to the eclectic \"yard art\" nature of this project. Every camera has a unique theme with a hidden meaning! Perhaps you discover it or you connect your own meaning to enjoy the visit. The deep playa is a gem, the citizens of the city that visit are rewarded with views and sounds many accidentally eschew. Please take a photo with your personal favorite and send it to me. After the event I will include it in a slideshow to be shared with the community. SLRT, where you capture an image of one of Black Rock City's  special places.",

As the night progresses Touffe evolves into a participant in the festival, bursting with multi color patterns of light, flashing, pulsing . . . dancing to the beats of the music.

Familiar because the first attempt, only 10' tall was attacked by arson in 2007, only to return to the playa in 2008 this time three times bigger and still in-progress, again in 2009 carved and finished and standing in a distinctive, rambling pedestal, more like a pyre. \r\n\r\nThe majestic sculpture becomes eerie, as flames begin slowly consuming her from INSIDE her chest until the flames roar! The hole gets bigger as the sculpture hollows from the passionate Fire Inside her! The fire is extinguished before the sculpture looses structure. Later the delicate char textures will be hardened in a special finishing process developed especially for this all new fire art form. \r\n\r\nThe curious playa artifact will be shared in default from Decomps to public showings as far and wide as possible!\r\n\r\nCome, watch her burn, starting at sunset Tuesday night; or in the case of high winds, Wednesday, sunset...",

The house up close, is comprised of human souls that make up the mortar and stone. As the house crumbles, these spirits are set free. The piece conveys escape, release and regrowth. It's a visual essay on the theme of entrapment and freedom. As we travel through human life, we are broken down and destroyed.  This loss enables us to re-create ourselves so we can transform into different type of being. The wall is a bright green, patinaed by desert sun, and the figures will blossom out of the firmament to tell their own haunted stories.\r\n\r\nThe house is a place of security which is now lost. It's haunted by the lives that have resided there. As the dwelling crumbles, the freed souls flee into the new haven of the desert which is  its own trap.  This cycle of human life is our constant quest for that one 'Soul Refuge'.  (sole refuge)",

To take something mostly associated with religion and indoor churches, and evolve it into something to be celebrated for everyone who wanders by, while still maintaining the essence of intricacy, self-reflection, and community gathering traditional to the medium. \r\n\t\t\r\nThis evolution also opens up a world of tactile interaction that was previously unaccessible with stained glass windows for fear of shattering and destroying the art. The piece at its core is a delicately-patterned piece of art that can be safely experienced hands-on and visually via distorted reflections from mirror pieces.\r\n\r\nThe structure resembles an archway from certain angles and colorful reflective spokes coming out of the playa from others.",

This impossibly long hallway lined with overly large childhood games is decorated in a 1920's style. Games like: Simon, Connect 4, Battleship are being played by others consumed with Wonderlust. Exploring this hallway of coalesced time, you feel as if you are getting larger! Space is also compressing! By the time you reach the hallway's end, you are GIANT! There you find a live Zoltar waiting! Searching for an escape, you enter a portal into another dimension ruled by the rich tones of a handmade organ performed by another chrononaut. This calmer world lacks spatial compression, the walls and floor are covered with curves, spirals and fun house mirrors, leaving you with the spins. You try your hand at the keyboard... As if your fingers were possessed, that tune you played as a kid fills the air. Your song ends and you make for the door, now with a sense of Wonderlust!",

When a person finally enters the space they see a glowing platform (15x10). \r\nParticipants are greeted by a Krivis (shaman) who leads them to a mirror altar in the center of the platform which comes alive as a musical instrument if you interact with it. The altar allows participants to compose music as easy as Lego pieces: sound loops of basslines, drums, melodies & vocals can be combined in thousands of different variations by placing special controllers on the instrument\u2019s surface.  This includes recordings of Baltic folk artists using traditional instruments, electronics, hip-hop and more.

The front facing portion of the machine is a booth that has a live gypsy style fortune teller. On the side of the machine you encounter turning gears, noises, lights & play along improv as your token transforms. As you follow the coin's progress along the machine you stop at several different points of interactivity, each designed to challenge your perception of what a real carnival game should be. Witty banter is the game here & a positive attitude & willingness to play along is how you win.",

Come, if you dare.\"\r\n\r\nThere he sees a sign with a challenge: \"Come alone or with a few friends. Take a trip into your soul.\"\r\n\r\nThen he walks into the tent to see that it is almost empty, except for a few paintings in the shadows. It is dark in there, he can barely see. But just enough to find his way to one of the paintings. Then the faint light quenched. He sees the scene there:\r\n\r\nA man who craves power so much, that he sacrifices the lives of others. He sees that this man is him, it has his face. It's part of he who craves power much more than looking after others. \r\nHe goes further and sees another scene. Again illuminated with another faint light. He sees himself covered in luxury furs, and a horrible death of many animals.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes and more paintings, he finally comes out. Outside of the waxworks of the human soul. His soul.\r\n\r\nEveryone carries demons. It is up to us if we give them life.",

The buttons will have an image/phrase that correlates to the respective chakra meaning, in some way... Some of the buttons might be tricks!

When the lights went down, the carnival awoke. Carnies tantalized and promised, hemmed and hawed. \"Passerby beware, but not over here!\" was the promise. Behind the tents, the seedy and profane were flowing with ease for those that were willing to venture back. As participants approach the Sparkade the first thing they will notice is the Wheel of Misfortune Twister game wheel mounted to the informative and clearly labeled facade. As their eyes dart to the floor, the ominousness Twister pattern overtakes the entire floor space. Upon entering the stall, the participant will be drawn towards either the Self-Serve Selfie Station, Love Machine, Swag Glory Hole, or the Cock Ring Toss.",

Above the platform, at the base of the pyramid, is another qi field data collector. The wheel has discs that are set to the seeker's animal, element and polarity (based on Chinese astrology). The seeker selects a tarot card to act as archetype (and clicker as the wheel spins). The seeker then expresses qi into the collector pads, aligning the wheel with the seeker's qi field. When the qi field is aligned, the seeker spins the wheel, which stops on the seeker's fortune.\r\n\r\nSometimes the seeker is unable to grok the fortune.

Often hawking the lurid, morbid or the taboo, banners lured the carnival \"peeps\" to spend their nickles to see the forbidden exhibits \"on the inside\".  \r\n\r\nBilled as \"ALIVE!- SHOCKING!- AMAZING!\"-  and brightly colored, sideshow banners were the alluring bait that made the sideshow a fixture of the carnival culture for more than a century.  \r\n\r\nIn recent years, sideshow art has gone from being nearly forgotten, to being recognized as a uniquely American cultural art form.\r\n\r\nStep right up!  Stop! Look through he doorway!! It's all on the inside!",

There are shimmering mirrored columns flanking the fish giving the Burner a panoramic view of the school, but also transforming the playa.  The mirrors compress the surrounding mountains, placing the playa in a different place or time.\r\n\r\nAt night as one gets near to the edge of the school bathed in 'water light' the fish at the edge glow brightly briefly and transmit their excitement to neighboring fish sequentially, giving the illusion of movement within the school.",

This year, the Temple of Promise welcomes participants through an archway soaring 97 feet overhead. Once inside, the structure curves in on itself, tapering in width and height down to just 7 feet tall. Along the way, alcoves formed by the supporting arches, as well as wooden sculptures reminiscent of stones in a stream, create altars and semi-private spaces for individuals and smaller gatherings. The lines of the curved wooden walls draw the eye inward and create a canvas for written messages and mementos. As the path continues to curve, it opens into the contemplative altar and the heart of the Temple: a grove of three sculpted trees. The branches are initially bare. Participants will write messages on long strips of cloth and attach them to the trees, creating the gentle shade of Weeping Willows, increasing as the week progresses.",

Using a pulse sensor the person currently interacting with the piece places their hand on the sensor. While reading their pulse the machine lights up around the King inside to the rhythm of their pulse, making the experience unique to the participant. While reading the pulse the King begins to shake his instrument of fun, a Martini shaker, while he contemplates their fortune. After 30 seconds the King speaks his words of wisdom and the participant is presented with a quest dispensed from lower in the machine that will challenge them to perform a specific task or quest that will send them on their playa journey. We believe that while giving a fortune would tell them WHAT will happen, sending them on a quest sends them somewhere to MAKE something happen. They become participants in the Black Rock City experience rather than spectators.",

From a distance, it appears as a solid cube but intricate spaces can be discovered when you get closer. The iridescent colours of crystal translate into the proposal through coloured LED, built into the lumber structure, so at night the pavilion gives the same visually mesmerizing, colourful effect of the crystals in nature.",

They show you not just what you look like, but who you are and how you are as an animated, living human being! Backwards mirrors take all of our vitality away and present a flat and distorted version of ourselves.  The design of the Palace will be using Giant Tinker Toys.  Who knew you could build something big with them?   Inside will be a warm, softly lighted environment that offers a host of interactivity and a truly unique experience \u2013 magical even!  There's a lot of science involved too, you can read some of the posters available. A lot of this makes perfect sense for why it should be so different, and so much better.\r\nPrepare to see something surprising about yourself\u2026you as a real, vibrant, and truly sparkling and happy human being. Or deep and genuine burner, with wisdom in your eyes.  Or whatever is true about you - your true image actually reflects all that information correctly, so you can continue to be true to yourself.  But be aware -  you have to \u201cbe it to see it\u201d.  Don\u2019t just stare at yourself - look in your eyes and interact! Ask questions about who you are, how you are, what\u2019s going on. Look with a friend, eye to eye, smile, then look back as you see the real version of you.  Who is the person that we see, who do we know, who do we love? You may need to get past your initial sense of how unusual it is, and no, you are not as asymmetric as your perception can be telling you.  But then you can see something truly magical\u2026the amazing burner that you really are!\r\nTo really make the point, look back to one of the backwards mirrors in the side panels, and notice how poorly mirrors reflect your true nature. Notice that the sparkle and light in your eyes just stops and you are staring, and more often than not, you become serious and doubtful.",

Whispering, softly a whisper becomes a murmur, gently a murmur becomes a sound before the faintest of echoes can be heard, it begins. At first a drop, motionless. Weeks pass, slowly, a drop becomes a trickle, trickling, creeping, a journey begins, weaving, the trickle meanders. With time it grows, a small stream flows, filling the cracks of the playa. A sapling emerges, twisting and winding it grows high above the ground, encircling itself, entwining itself. A figure of our memories, a myriad of our existence, its infinitude transcends time and like the stream to the tree we breathe life into the playa. A rest for our minds, a shelter for our bodies, a place not only to remember, a place to never forget. The Infinity Tree is symbol of what can never be lost, what will always be found, and what makes us who we are.",

The attraction is in being drawn in by the illusion of pennies being feathers.\r\nThe year marks the return of this sculpture which made it's debut in 2013 at Burning Man with only Canadian pennies on it's back. This year, Penny has been redesigned and will have American pennies on it's front side. A brighter and more effective light scheme will also be used this year.",

The classic video game tetris is played on a board blown up to epic proportions. Each square of the board is a steel box open at the front, creating a grid. The tetris pieces descending down this metal grid are rendered in flame, courtesy of 200 flame effect heads. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the traditional single player mode, Fire Tetris can be played with four participants in multiplayer mode. Each player controls one aspect of the piece\u2019s movement: left, right, rotate, and drop. While video games can be an isolating pursuit, this dramatic, highly visible metal monolith encourages cooperative play as well as appreciation from a larger audience while participants ANNIHILATE BLOCKS WITH FIRE.",

One imagines what creatures might evolve there in the heat and the dust, with the sun and the wind for power, with a peacock's urges to be admired day and night, with a joy in the solitude and the rough edges of the natural world that spawned them. What life forms might develop as the denizens of the Carnival of Mirrors if their constituent molecules were dust and rust and sunlight? \r\n\r\nAn answer to this question is The Dancing Serpent which will be a 14 foot long sculptural metal serpent constructed as a mobile. Canvas sails hang from the serpent to catch the wind, causing the sculpture to swim gracefully through the air, and propane flames sprout from an array of outlets along its spine and jaws.",

The Light Strikers will stand at an imposing but approachable 10 feet tall and will vary in form.  Lighting will be embedded into the forms on hierarchical levels activated through the main track of the striker.  The ball struck by the force of the lever will trigger switches to these lights, so that if the ball is struck to the top of the Light Striker then all the lighting on the form will be activated.\r\n    The main interactive component is the high striker mechanism.  Attention is focused on the person wielding the hammer, and the blow that lands causes an primal spike of energy which emanates upwards and outwards.  The goal of the Trials is to create a shared space of luminosity and exuberance on the playa. This would create a harmonizing space where and people can share these experiences and also forge new friendships.",

        "description": "On the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina founding of Burners Without Borders, the Krewe of the Dusty Playa presents a Mardi Gras-style float that offers a humorous critique of our two homes, New Orleans and Black Rock City. The symbols of the gentrification of NOLA neighborhoods that have survived both time and storm will be juxtaposed with the plug and play camps that are at the center of so much discussion in the Burner community.\r\nA large, colorful, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, jester\u2019s head created in the style of the Krewe of Rex will adorn the prow of a Mardi Gras float. The structure will be like a griffin, but instead of the head of an eagle and the body of a lion, the float will have the head of a jester and a body of a travel trailer.\r\nMade using traditional New Orleans papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 float construction, the float will be constructed using many of the same techniques, materials and by the same artists that carry on the tradition of Mardi Gras as members of New Orlean\u2019s Krewe du Vieux.",

The branching head area of the sculpture serves as a playful interactive space where participants can become literal neurotransmitters providing the necessary synaptic activation for the piece to come alive. Lighting elements with proximity awareness sensors responding to the movements of participants as they move through the piece will add an additional element to the piece at nite. The sculpture as a whole emanates a contemplative yet engaging quality. Our hope is to create a safe environment for participants to engage in a playful and intimate experience.",

Three main limbs branch out to form a canopy and support nine steelpans with a four octave range. When the keys of the piano are pressed, solenoids are actuated to strike the pans in the correct location to play the corresponding note. Because some notes overlap between pans, there are a total of 99 solenoids but only 48 notes, which means that some notes will have multiple pans being struck resulting in a rich, complex sound, much like a steelpan orchestra.\r\n\r\nAs you approach the piece at night, you will only see the piano by way of a piano lamp which illuminates the keyboard, and a piano bench which sits in front of the piano inviting you to play. When a note is played, each striker also has a high intensity white led light that flashes, lighting up the branches and pans in a sequence following the notes being played.",

The pole come in three heights, with the smallest paddlewheels being mounted on the tallest poles and the largest paddle wheels being mounted on the shortest poles.  This height and size arrangement takes advantage of an old Hollywood move trick called \u201cforced perspective\u201d and gives the illusion of a great deal of height separation.

This sculpture with its gentle overhead motion, and kaleidoscopic dance of light and shadow, will provide Burners with such a place.",

Its primary function is to promote recycling by facilitating limited art in action smelting and casting production events using recycled aluminum cans. The Dragon Smelter itself is a kinetic piece of sculpture which is made up of 60% recycled materials. It contains a propane-powered reduction furnace for the aluminum melting, has a rotation causable for safely pouring it into sand molds which contain designs by the artist and participants who learn to make casting molds through artist workshops. The Dragon Smelter also has fire effects which blow fire out the mouth and tail sections overhead.",

No fence keeps you out, but one hundred and eight lanterns mark out the space, like a fairy ring in the forest, like the hundred and eight beads of the Buddhist rosary. \r\n   \r\nThrough the archway you walk. Up the long, low steps, the muffled sound of your tread meets the familiar clunk of wood; the music of a seaside pier rises from the dust, invoking the sense of some long lost place where water once stretched out to kiss the horizon. Below, the improbable sounds of water and the briefest hints of ocean blue tickle the imagination. From above, eight dragons of fire and steel peer down, watching you, or look out into the distance, waiting.\r\n    \r\nAnd again, the thing that is neither quite plant nor place seems to hover at the edge of defining, the green rooftop like a lily pad, the great lotus rising up out of the dried mud and the memory of water, each petal big enough to sleep in, open out from this improbable tree, this pillar of memories.\r\n     \r\nInside, past and present blend and dance together. Old rites and new technologies bring fresh form to venerable, ancient practices. There is hidden circuitry here: casting the moon blocks reveals the will of the gods in a panoply of color and light. The breath of dragons explodes outward in answer to prayer. The goddess herself has been known to appear, if the moment is right.\r\n          \r\nYou leave the temple, clutching message and map, and the sound of music finds your ears. Drums, gongs and shouting voices emerge from fantastical shapes, finned and spiny, nautilus-headed dancers and demons with a thousand eyes walk out of the dust, beckoning you to join them. You wonder, for a moment, if you are in fact in a desert, or in the memories of an ancient ocean, seeing the dreams of the sea floor dancing past.",

It represents the fork in the road, a point of decision and departure.\r\nStanding in front of the fork is a 10' tall obelisk in the shape of a turning post. Atop the post are motion sensors.  When activated, hands pop up pointing the way to a new direction.\r\nSpiraling down the obelisk is a plaque which bears the conundrum: \"If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.\"  This is synonymous with the seeker who has many roads to choose.  On the Playa there are no roads so the choices are limitless.",

In this chapter the Acolytes, inspired by experience gained in the Agora of Light, leave their brethren and shatter forth, embarking on individual pilgrimages of virtue.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in their lives they were alone in the world. Initial interactions with people were bright with conviction and exaltation, each Acolyte advocating from the pulpit of their chosen virtue. However, they observed those with courage act without honor, justice act without wisdom. Idealism shaken, each wondered \"How can any single virtue be the only light that guides one towards a life worth living?\"\r\n\r\nAfter an eternity of seeing only hope on the horizon, a dark, distant well appears. As each labored step brings them closer to The Well of Darkness the Acolytes begin to recognize their friends, who, just like them are dragging a box heavy with the weight of virtue.",

It plays with the literal reflections created by mirrored facets and provokes personal and inward reflection. The intriguing outer walls resemble ornate Chinese folding screens. Once inside Burners will find a mysterious mirrored crystalline sculpture which will reflect their crazy decorated bodies in its multiple facets and encourage spontaneous and uninhibited performances. The tattoo imagery of the intricately laser-cut petal walls is inspired by the magnificent Tattooed Ladies of the early 20th Century Travelling Carnivals. The \u2018skin\u2019 of the Cirque celebrates these Ladies as early pioneers of Radical Self Expression. It reminds us that our bodies are our personal canvas and how we paint, ink, pierce and decorate them, clothe and conceal them, flaunt and expose them, remains our own very personal choice. Elegant mirrored images of contortionists in the lower panels also celebrate the marvels of the human body.",

Traditionally, a kaleidoscope is a triangular prism, comprised of mirrors with loose beads or pieces of glass held at the end opposite the eye hole.  When rotated, the moving pieces create colourful patterns with an effect that is absolutely mesmerizing.  Our intention is to give the viewer that same feeling of awe, as when they first looked through that tiny eyehole as a child.\r\n\r\nThis kaleidoscope has been scaled up to eleven feet long and the colourful beads have been replaced with colourful humans.  The scope manually rotates within a cradle at a height people can easily look through and even climb inside.  Lights around the openings frame the image, accentuating the triangulated pattern and provide a brilliant invitation to explore.  Everyone becomes an integral part of the interactive experience - Voyeurs become participants and the adventurous become part of the world within.",

        "description": "Simon, Fire Edition 2.0 is inspired by the golden-age of arcade games.  \u201cCarnival of Mirrors\u201d evokes the need for tests of skill: e.g. milk jug ball tossing and popping balloons with darts.  Simon, as a memory game, is by definition a test of skill and meets the Principle of Radical Inclusion by being easily accessible by its basis as a childrens\u2019 game.  The principles of Interactivity and Immediacy are met by a flame effect game.  That is, the sculpture is animated by Interactivity and rewards the participant with immediate gratification proportional to the interaction, setting up a virtuous cycle.  What the original game lacks, this project delivers: a win-condition with lighting, sound and flame effect display.  Bluntly, we feel that a game of Simon within the \u201cCarnival of Mirrors\u201d theme with a light, sound and flame effect display is a winning combination.",

Experience cathartic release as you liberate your secrets, unearth the hidden lives of those around you, and test your fortune and powers for uncovering concealed nooks and hidden compartments holding relics and gifts from the artists' own hands.\r\n\r\nUpon approaching the 50' edifice, whose design recalls ancient Khmer and Vedic architecture, revelers bask in the beauty and chaos of black and white photography in assemblage with salvaged and re-purposed mixed media.  In the middle of the great room, a golden confessional stands as a portal to revelation and  interaction with the art and other participants.\r\n\r\nMysteries and discoveries will reveal themselves in the installation's details and will, in turn, inspire visitors to explore their own hidden meanings and inner worlds.",

The translation across the twist signals a transformation in the challenge, the point at which the journey's end is in sight.

        "description": "Burning Man is a sexualized environment where participants try to channel their intentions and extinguish their frustrations. \"Love Tester\" challenges participants to harness a meditative state amidst the sensory overload of our physical environment, and calls into question the sexual vs spiritual aspects of love which are often obscured by desire.\r\n\r\nIt is said Kundalini, a snake, lies coiled at the base of the spine, close to the sexual organs. Traditions of Tantra claim that meditation can clear blockages at each \"chakra\", thus permitting Kundalini to rise up the spine to the crown of the head.\r\n\r\nThis piece is inspired by the vintage arcade cabinet, \"Love Tester\", where a grip is squeezed, causing a stack of rainbow light bulbs to rise, to a level supposedly indicating one's aptitude as a lover. Rather than trying to raise the lights toward Kundalini and enlightenment, participants will try to extinguish the lights, top-down, in an attempt to quell their desires and quieten their mind.",

As the sole remaining structure of this ghost town, the chapel captures the pilgrims\u2019 peculiar affinity for worshiping the wind and the beautiful mysteries this silent force creates on the open plain. Twin copper wind harps flank the canvas chapel, enticing lost travelers with a dreamy siren song.  Towering over the altar is a 40 ft. steel windmill which pumps a Victorian reed organ and two wood and metal pipe organs. Evoking the melancholic demise of the wind worshiping Aeolians, modern pilgrims can play three wind-powered keyboards, filling the restored chapel with the ephemeral sounds of yesterday. The Prairie Wind Chapel welcomes all wayfarers with its songs!",

        "description": "Fire Helix is a 12' tall rotating double helix made of aluminum with flame poofers located at dna nodes firing parallel with the ground. Control pads that surround the piece allow participants to fire the poofers causing the helix to spin.\r\n\r\nThe double helix is the building block of life.  Fire is one of the building blocks of civilization.  Together we believe there is an elegant mix of meaning that draws the mind to the ephemeral questions of what brought us here and what will we do with the fantastic tools and opportunity we find ourselves surrounded by.\r\n\r\nThere is something about fire in motion that captivates us in both mind and spirit.  The moment becomes everything and we lose ourselves in the purity of the now.  As the mind unwinds in this state we often have realizations that only occur when everything else fades into the background.  This simple captivating experience is what Fire Helix embodies.",
