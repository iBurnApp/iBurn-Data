By blending hand selected music provided by international talent with art, comedy, comfort, and an intense lack of drama, we create a unique oasis off the beaten path. We prefer to stay out of the limelight - making it a pleasant surprise to stubble upon if you’re exploring without a set destination. \r\n\r\nExperience the 360 sound system and sound-2-light installation for performances, relax to ambient music after-hours, bounce around on Kangraoo Shoes if your timing is right, motorboat some titties after a fresh shotgun to the face, and toss the bocce or baggo with your homies - ALL at Music Savages Camp.",

We'll help you find out – come play, there are no spectators here!\r\n \r\nWICKEDLAND brings your favorite childhood fairytale heroes and their archetypal stories back to life.

At the end of the day control light with your mind or sit in our sauna dome.\r\n\r\nIs your mind blown? No? Well aren’t you the adventurous soul.

    "description": "SERENDIPITEA, meanwhile let's have a sip of Tea. \r\n\r\nSERENDIPITEA focuses on the communal aspects of tea rituals around the globe. Tea is something close to our hearts in the UK, but is also a significant to many different cultures; whether it is a tall iced glass of sweet tea in the southern US, or a steaming cup of mint tea served from a silvery teapot in Morocco- all are symbols of hospitality and friendship bringing us closer as a whole. We took a lot of inspiration from the Book of Tea written in 1906 by Okakura Kakuzō of Japan in English, he addressed the growing concern of clash between the east and west cultures. The struggle he speaks of resonates with the modern cultural issues facing society, the very issues that Burning Man explores.",

    "description": "The Space Virgin Arts Collective is a 501c3 non-profit arts group with the mission of building community through collaboration. We started as a Seattle-based Burning Man theme camp in 1994, but we have since grown and our projects include off-playa art projects and events. In keeping with the Burning Man philosophy \"no observers, only participants\", our art is often interactive and experiential, plunging participants into theatrical-style sets and engendering joyful, transformative experiences.",

Share your aspirations on the Tree of Dreams. Unburden your woes on the Tree of Prayers. Take a quiet moment out of your day to pray or meditate. Align your mind and spirit with Mimosa Vinyasa (Wed 5-6PM BYOM). Connect to each other at our modern partner-dancing workshops in costume (Tutu Tuesday 4:30-6PM + Bunny Thursday 3-4:30PM)! Join us for our Harry Potter cocktail hour dressed in your favorite color of the rainbow (Friday 5-7PM BYOC, starting with Andy’s standup routine)! We dare you to come sit in the Bad Advice Chair. You may even find yourself in the middle of an impromptu flow jam or fire spinning session. Even if it’s something as simple as dancing to our live beats or relaxing in the shade of our visually stimulating Dome, we hope you leave the Naked Rainbow with the most vibrant hues of your soul revealed.",

Our response is that humans can discover their true nature through yoga and meditation. Self-discovery is a process of lighting up the mythic metaphor of the \"rainbow bridge.\" Anodea Judith writes that \"on our journey through life, the chakras are the wheels along this axis that take the vehicle of the Self along our evolutionary quest, across the Rainbow Bridge, to reclaim our divine nature once again...to restore the Rainbow Bridge is to reconnect to our own divinity, anchoring it in the world around us and healing the rifts that so plague our world.\"\r\n\r\nIn interacting with other burners, we would like to focus on 7 chakras over 7 days. We will offer a daily practice tied to each Chakra leading up to the lotus / crown / diamond chakra the day the man burns.",
