The Tesla Coil will be located on the Playa, just across from the Esplanade. Be mindful of the safety fence around the individual 32’ Tesla towers, but feel welcome to stroll through the Faraday Tunnel and stand at the very center of the action. Who will you meet while standing under 4 million Volts? This system will not have the harsh din of a typical Tesla Coil; expect the rumble of a low Bass note. Pro tip; visit the portos in advance!  Next up: our signature 52’ Tower right on the Esplanade! The Tower will be lit brightly and visible from across the Playa as a distinctive feature of our cityscape.Your journey up the Tower begins with a cozy shaded & lit lounge at Playa level with carpets, bean bags, pillows and blankets. Perfect for a friendly chat, or a full on cuddle puddle! We typically provide coffee table books and a massage table and other basic creature comforts to encourage people to spend time in a friendly and welcoming environment. Rest up and stay as long as you like 24/7.  Next, ascend to Vünderbar, Ze Bar In Ze Sky! The bar floor is 16’ off the Playa, but you may sit 19’ up on our leather stools and rest against the bar. Hang your purse on the hooks and take in the libations! New for 2015: Railings! Lean against the edges without fear of imminent death and look all around. Vünderbar is a place where ten to twenty fellow Burners may gaze out at the beauty of Black Rock City day and night, and meet new friends in an environment similar to an intergalactic departure lounge. That may be the love of your life two stools down; you better say hi! Vünderbar is a 24/7 establishment! That rope ladder isn’t going to climb itself! You will find the very top of the Tower features a 52’ tall Crow’s Nest for up to five people to see Black Rock City in all its glory! This is a great place to take photos. Spend as long as you like and remember, Radical Self Reliance! The Crow’s Nest is open 24/7! Climbing down a Tower is old news. Sextant strongly recommends that you take advantage of the Zip-Line clip-in point 48’ off the Playa (just beneath the Crow’s Nest)! Attach your provided safety harness to the trolley and soar over Black Rock City for 350’, all the way to Arcade Street. Due to the severity of the safety situation, Sextant only operates the Zip-Line if conditions are appropriate.After all this hustle and bustle on the Esplanade, we want to encourage you to explore the neighborhood! What better way to experience the intimacy of the off-Esplanade lifestyle, than to start at the Landing Zone Café at the end of the Zip-Line. You’ll find a laid-back atmosphere with some shade, chairs and bicycle parking (where applicable). Wake up your bartender and ask if they would be so kind as to share a drink with you!<br>Events: <br>Link: https://www.facebook.com/sextantcamp<br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yhH7tmA.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hqiWvND.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZzg2YHJi34\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/xZzg2YHJi34/hqdefault.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /></a><br><br><a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZzg2YHJi34\">https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZzg2YHJi34</a>","Village":"DUSTFISH Village","Sector":7.5,"Address":"6:30 & Esplanade, Black Rock City, NV","Location":"6:30 & Esplanade, Black Rock City, NV","Description":"First up: Massive Tesla Coils on the Playa!

Hang your purse on the hooks and take in the libations! New for 2015: Railings! Lean against the edges without fear of imminent death and look all around. Vünderbar is a place where ten to twenty fellow Burners may gaze out at the beauty of Black Rock City day and night, and meet new friends in an environment similar to an intergalactic departure lounge. That may be the love of your life two stools down; you better say hi! Vünderbar is a 24/7 establishment! That rope ladder isn’t going to climb itself! You will find the very top of the Tower features a 52’ tall Crow’s Nest for up to five people to see Black Rock City in all its glory! This is a great place to take photos. Spend as long as you like and remember, Radical Self Reliance! The Crow’s Nest is open 24/7! Climbing down a Tower is old news. Sextant strongly recommends that you take advantage of the Zip-Line clip-in point 48’ off the Playa (just beneath the Crow’s Nest)! Attach your provided safety harness to the trolley and soar over Black Rock City for 350’, all the way to Arcade Street. Due to the severity of the safety situation, Sextant only operates the Zip-Line if conditions are appropriate.After all this hustle and bustle on the Esplanade, we want to encourage you to explore the neighborhood! What better way to experience the intimacy of the off-Esplanade lifestyle, than to start at the Landing Zone Café at the end of the Zip-Line. You’ll find a laid-back atmosphere with some shade, chairs and bicycle parking (where applicable). Wake up your bartender and ask if they would be so kind as to share a drink with you!","Events":null,"Link":"https://www.facebook.com/sextantcamp","gx_media_links":"http://i.imgur.com/5IWm0N3.jpg http://i.imgur.com/yhH7tmA.jpg http://i.imgur.com/hqiWvND.jpg https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZzg2YHJi34","id":7781,"address":"6:30 & Esplanade","latitude":40.78292090000596,"longitude":-119.21454332451401},{"name":"Dusty Bumm","styleUrl":"#icon-503-00FF49","styleHash":"-1490c6a8","description":"Village: <br>Sector: 6<br>Address: 6:30 & Geek, Black Rock City, NV<br>Location: 6:30 & Geek, Black Rock City, NV<br>Description: or as we like to call it...6:30 & G-String ;)<br>Come Trade in your dusty tookus for a warm drink and a cold slap in the face or plow it up with a snowboardski or three.

The camps started in 2010 with the original Orphan Endorphin camp, and has now expanded to three camps. The concept behind the Orphanage is that each camp offers a different experience for the virgin and orphan burner. The main Orphan Endorphin camp offers an ‘urban’, loud and busy, experience being located at 7:00 & A in 2015. ORPHANS TOO offers a quieter, less busy, ‘suburban experience. The third camp, Li’l Orphan Annex is in a very quiet, ‘rural’ location, located at 7:15 & H. ORPHANS TOO has a strong ethos of participation and nurturing virgin and orphan burners.  <br>ORPHANS TOO has expanded over the last two years, and now has a significant amount of interactivity. A lot of this interactivity comes from the virgin burners themselves. In 2015 we have 46 virgin burners out of a camp of 72. The ORPHANS TOO team works hard with our virgins to encourage them to work together in the months leading up to the burn to plan a variety of interactivity. One example of this is a group of our virgins this year forming a music and theatre troupe called the “Hard Knocks”. They are planning various events for the week. Another example is the creation of a “Cabinet of Curios” in the theme of the Carnival of Mirrors - again, being planned by a group of our virgin burners. A third example is the suggestion by one of our virgins that we expand the Funky Flower Garden to include Funky Creatures such as insects, lizards and butterflies – and she will be bringing materials to the playa to allow people to create their own on the playa.<br>Events: -THE ASYLUM BAR is an extremely popular suburban bar on the playa. It was located at 7.10 & H in 2014 and was busy throughout the whole week, mainly during the day and up until about midnight. The bar provides high-quality beer and vodkas to the public all week. The bar provides high quality microbrews and ciders from across the US, as well as homebrews from the Orphanage Homebrewers Group. The microbrews for 2015 are : Maui CoConut Porter, Old Guardian Barley Wine, Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, Victory Golden Monkey, Stone Stochasticity Project Grapefruit Slam IPA, Dirtwolf Double IPA, Angry Orchard Cider and Ace Joker Dry Hard Cider. Home brews will include Hoppy Wheat, Unicorn Blood, Ginger Beer, Hibiscus Saison and White Trash Champagne. There will be a variety of home infused vodkas, some of them smooth and more-ish, others lip-curlingly punchy! <br>-BARON OINK’S LATEX VAC BED & FLOGGING STOOL is scary but kinky. The Vac Bed is a 9 foot high blood red latex envelope, where one or two people can be vacuum sandwiched. Imagine Hans Solo encased in carbonite, but more saucy! The flogging stool is where victims can experience a flogging from a variety of whips, tawse, and floggers (consensual of course). Being encased in latex AND being flogged at the same time is the best experience!<br>-THE FUNKY FLOWER GARDEN is a very simple Art Project concept. But also very effective and interactive. The idea was borne from the close relationship between the ORPHANS TOO camp and the Netherlands burner community. Jason Avery (me) was a member of the Netherlands Burning Man Committee. The idea is that anyone can design and create a Funky Flower and bring it to the playa to be enjoyed. Ideally Funky Flowers are lit at night. The flowers can be very simple or extremely bizarre. Usually up to 2 feet high. Anybody can design and create a Funky Flower and bring it to ORPHANS TOO. Including people from other camps and the wider Burning Man community. We will even be encouraging burners who are not coming to Burning Man this year to create Funky Flowers and have someone else bring them on their behalf. In 2015, at the suggestion of one of our virgin burners, we shall be expanding the Funky Flower Garden to include Funky Creatures such as spiders, lizards and butterflies.<br>-THE BIG TOP BOUDOIR is the ORPHANS TOO hangout to relax in. Every year we create this relaxing space in the theme of the year. In 2015 it will be in the style of a Big Top Boudoir. Again, the virgins in our camp are working together to design and decorate the space, including carnival mirrors and masks. The Boudoir will be open to the whole of Black Rock City 24 hours per day all week. We regularly have many visitors that use it as a place to relax and reflect. Included within the Big Top Boudoir will be the CABINET OF CURIOS. In the style of the carnival, this will be a cabinet display where people will bring bizarre artifacts either to display, or to gift.<br>-\the HARD KNOCKS is a troupe of musical and theatrical performers. Coincidentally, of our 46 virgin burners, many are musicians and actors. We have therefore formed a troupe of virgin burners who will be putting on various performances throughout the week. There will be live music and live theatre. It is amazing what can be achieved by properly recruiting and encouraging virgin burners!<br>-OTHER PROJECTS. We are also planning other ad-hoc art projects. For example, one of our virgins is making a human-sized Ouija board. And others are making an art project around helium balloons lit at night.  <br>-Finally, the SPUTNIK fire barrel is an ORPHANS TOO institution, having been procured for the camp back in 2011.

Of the 7 art cars moored at Disorient this year, particularly noticeable was the DEX 2014 iteration performed by Elixir, B-Shyne and the Disorient Philadelphia Cell.","Events":null,"Link":"http://www.disorient.info","gx_media_links":"http://i.imgur.com/M0BsW6l.png","id":7718,"latitude":40.78798409999728,"longitude":-119.21546957991231},{"name":"Big Puffy Yellow","styleUrl":"#icon-503-00FF49","styleHash":"-1490c6a8","description":"<img src=\"http://s2.postimg.org/sba6xzre1/1376407_558208304249146_625421948_n_jpg_oh_45ab8.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br>Village: <br>Sector: 6<br>Address: <br>Location: 6:15 & Geek, Black Rock City, NV<br>Description: What began as a Burning Man Theme Camp in 1999 has grown into a collective of Burners, Artists, DJs, Performers and general Badasses who love all things Big Puffy and Yellow!<br>Events: <br>Link: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Puffy-Yellow/558193654250611","Village":null,"Sector":"6.0","Address":null,"Location":"6:15 & Geek, Black Rock City, NV","Description":"What began as a Burning Man Theme Camp in 1999 has grown into a collective of Burners, Artists, DJs, Performers and general Badasses who love all things Big Puffy and Yellow!","Events":null,"Link":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Puffy-Yellow/558193654250611","gx_media_links":"http://s2.postimg.org/sba6xzre1/1376407_558208304249146_625421948_n_jpg_oh_45ab8.jpg","id":7114,"latitude":40.77927470001218,"longitude":-119.21961704063253},{"name":"Abstininthe","styleUrl":"#icon-503-00F3FF","styleHash":"-7a23cb28","description":"<img src=\"http://www.abstininthe.com/logo.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br>Village: <br>Sector: 7.5<br>Address: <br>Location: 7:30 Plaza, Black Rock City, NV<br>Description: Abstininthe is the friendly bar on the playa providing our special absinthe drink to the thirsty of BRC since the last millennium.
