It reminded them of home.\r\n\r\nSoul Brunch isn't just a party; it's like the backyard barbecues of home. It's like the cookouts of yesteryear. As your families invited your communities over, as the generations of soul families invited their communities over, so too does the Heroes & Super Villains family invite the Playa community over to eat together, drink together, get to know one another, dance with each other and uplift each other.\r\n\r\nFrom morning until nightfall, our trained chefs serve up the freshest breakfast burritos on the Playa, accompanied by professionally made craft cocktails. Our collection of international DJs spin smooth beats until nightfall.\r\n\r\nWe also give revelers a chance to clean up with our Soul Power Showers; guests experience the rebirth and rejuvenation of cool, cleansing water sprayed forcefully from our pressurized washer system (imagine a water saving car wash inside our shower areas for guests). Baptized anew, heroes set out on their way spreading positive vibes.\r\n\r\nDJ Lineup:\r\n-Marques Wyatt\r\n-Nicodemus\r\n-Deep Woods\r\n-Sabo\r\n-Rafael de la Cruz",

When you are holding onto your creative expression, your gifts, your particular genius, or pretending not to know what it is, it's gets very uncomfortable after a while. It will start itching inside of you to be created in physical form, it's deepest desire is to be born out of the dream space. You came to Planet Earth to share this, now is your time. Calling all healers, conversation-starters, rebels, light-workers, and medicine women. This workshop is broken down into four magical sections. \r\n\r\n1) Connection. How relating to others is the number one function of your business or passion project. We begin the workshop with getting connected on the soul level to your fellow sisters.\r\n2) Reclaiming Your Unique Brilliance. Refining your message and creating something in the world that is unique, contributive, and that people will pay for. \r\n3) Healing Your Relationship With Money. Girl, if you want to start or expand your business, you've got to look at your drama and trauma with money. What would it be like if money flowed to you with ease? What would it be like if you could actually receive it? We will dive into this exploration together.\r\n4) Closing Ritual. Our closing ritual will include a beautiful ceremony to hold each others intentions and desires as we go create in the world. You will be let into a \"light-share\" experience.",

The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites. It takes every single one of us to make Burning Man happen...",

This is like the Museum of Burningman Bodies. Within each pod we each have 2-3 minutes to tell our museum visitors about our body. Depending on group vibe and any time left, viewers may ask questions of the exhibit, or  request something they would like to be uplifted upon. The next person presents. This workshop will be tested this coming week at a regional burn. I‚Äôve started something without structure before at a workshop intensive of 18 people.

In brief: we choose a location, sit and write for ten minutes or so, share what we have written, and move on to another location. The only response we give to each others' writing is \"thank you.\" \r\nWe will likely depart from the Midway around 3:50 after we get ourselves organized and sit down to \"write out the cobwebs.\" Participate for as long as you wish.

We want to create a home of warmth and positive energy during the AM hours. Together with a team of artists, musicians, circus performers, dancers, planners, bartenders, builders, architects, thinkers, dreamers, and lovers, we are going to bring invigorating house music to the Burning Man community and a dance floor that gets everyone moving and shaking. We'll offer you champagne to relax and a comfy chill space to enjoy the sounds while resting your feet. We want to provide an environment conducive to connecting: spiritually, conversationally, and energetically.",

How to be safe on the rails, not get arrested, and enjoy a rugged adventure.   Hitchhiking sucks!   Freight trains don't go everywhere but they can get you far and fast toward your destination.  Having no destination is even better!   Learn what to carry with you, where to ride on a train, and how to keep a low profile.  Also learn how freight trains operate, where they stop, and how to find a 'friendly' railroad worker with whom to communicate.  Familiarize yourself with the 'Do's and Don'ts' of freight train hopping and discover the last shred of what real freedom means in America.",

The Chakraland game is a 22×30 foot vinyl flooring of a multicolored human sized game that participants play by rolling the giant dice and moving towards the different colored squares, each square representing a different chakra. The layout is similar to the child’s game “Candyland”. The squares will all have different quests written on them that need to be completed in a certain timeframe, or players have to go back to the previous square of the same color. There are some short cuts, wild pink squares, and black lose-a-turn squares. The winner makes it to the end of the colored path and gets loved up by the colorful game jesters. Yay, so much fun!",

Yet, some of us spend big bucks preparing and getting to Black Rock City. So, even here money talks even if we pretend not to listen.\r\n \r\nStill some of us struggle off the Playa with not  having enough,  wrestle with “it is never enough” or believe financial issues are too taboo to explore out loud, \r\n \r\nPerhaps for the first time, we will really listen to the voices we hear in our heads or the ones we don’t even know exist which block us from creating abundance and banishing scarcity.\r\n \r\nSo, in a safe and supportive environment come sing with your shadows, dance with the almighty dollar  and wake up to where you are financially   so you can return to your life away from Burning Man ready to make money your ally and not your enemy.",

Chanting, dancing and other ritualistic strategies will generate a massive collective energy. No experience necessary!  For the generally creative and outgoing. It manifests a collective spirit as we create a sacred space for transformation and rebirth. Inspiration, identity and rebirth take morphing, sculptural form. The Cocoon is a hand-crafted stretchy fabric enclosure created by Sherry Aliberti, an architect and performance artist based in New York City. Structurally, these postures represent a scale model of an architecture and materiality based on the forces of the body. The Cocoon Project is a multi-disciplinary collaborative performing the Cocoon with movers, live projected visuals and soundscape. The performed-installation conveys a primordial one-ness of many bodies within the sheer membrane. CocoonNYC performs site-specifically in galleries, music venues and alternative spaces. The Cocoon experience can be emotionally powerful for every age and/or background.",

The workshop begins with a ritual purification, connecting heart, body, mind, and spirit. Then it moves you into a deeper state of consciousness and closer to your individual and collective soul’s purpose. Utilizing dance, contemporary shamanism, hands on healing, drumming and global music, this powerful and beautiful soul work sheds inhibitions and heightens inner awareness in a safe and carefully monitored group setting. Dancers are blindfolded in the shamanic tradition and step beyond their conscious fears and limitations and allow their innermost creative sides to break free. Dancers tune in to sound and movement to take an inner journey exploring a trance-like state of self-discovery and self-realization.",

It's what pushes people to the point of insanity; that unexplainable quality that pulls people to the dark side. Some days, Dark Sparkle is your alter-ego; other days it is your most natural feeling form. Dark Sparkle is Mona Lisa's smile, biscuits and gravy, the Fonz, the apocalypse. It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace. Our shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease. Featuring your favorite DS performers as well as guests from the BRC community. We'll also turn the tables with ample opportunity for participation. Contact: srodenburg@gmail.com",

Given the breadth of ages, we'll do our best to cover as many age groups as we can with our science stations.\r\nWe'll also be screen printing a custom Science+Kids+CMGC graphic! Bring over a shirt or other material to receive the print! (cotton/poly blend is good and it needs to be fairly clean)\r\n\r\nParents, come over and take a seat. We'll chat with the kiddos for a while so have a refreshing adult beverage, relax for a bit, and get to know your friendly CMGC crew. (psss... we have a lot of adult oriented events as well, come back at 4 pm!)\r\nWe're commonly found in the 7:45ish area between B-D, but be sure to check the camp placement roster before heading over.",

        "description": "My camp, the Free Photography Zone, has been doing portraits of the participants of Burning Man continuously for the past 19 years.  Each person, or group, is photographed in a studio setting and given an instant print as their tangible reminder of their Burning Man experience.  I then photograph then on medium format black and white film so that, if they wish, they can get prints at a later date.\r\n\r\nThese are not a re-do of your high school yearbook portrait just in Burning Man attire.  I try to give each person enough time to help me make a lasting photograph.  On our gallery walls in our shade structure there are black and white prints ranging in size from 16x20\" to 4x5' that I hope will be of some inspiration to you.  Though I try not to duplicate what I have done in the past they may serve as a jumping off point for our photography session.  Not the easiest thing given the approximately 47,000 black and white negatives done so far.  I have never counted and see no reason to start now.\r\n\r\nI consider the people I photograph as the most important part of any photograph and always try my best to make a photograph that will be of lasting value and interest well beyond the moment of its creation.\r\n\r\nCome, join me, and together we may make something wonderful.  \r\n\r\nI usually begin each day about 10 or 11 AM and continue into the night till I can't keep on my feet any longer.  Weather permitting I'll begin on Sunday August 30th through Saturday September 5th.\r\n\r\nI do look forward to photographing you.",

Participants can come and list what they want or may have to gift. If a participant doesn't have something, we'll provide a gift of their choosing. Then using a trade-loop algorithm a web of exchanged items is created that pairs participants with gifts they want. No bartering or haggling occurs because the person giving the gift is almost never the person the receiver exchanges their item with. Everyone gets something they wanted, the only \"value\" created is completely subjective to the recipient. For those who only wish to give, we photograph them and give their item's recipient their photo/information to potentially interact with later. Those without anything to give can still participate and will always receive something in the exchange.",

The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy.

Fire has been used to increase the yield of wild crafted harvests, hunting practices, and the control of watershed resources.

For those trekking across the barren wasteland, evading the dozen or so security and law enforcement agencies, avoiding detection by radar and heat sensors, struggling to finally reach the perimeter fence; our Bar is there to offer you an ice cold beverage and welcome you Home with a hug, brother/sister, before contacting the proper authorities and turning you over to security.\r\n\r\nFor several years I have rode my bicycle with trailer out to the furthest point in Black Rock City with all the booze, juice, water, soda and ice I could fit in the 3 large ice-chests. I purposely set up at the remotest spot I can find, away from camps, sound systems, art vehicles and crowds.  Trying to provide a service to intrepid playa explorers, people out riding bikes along the trash fence, those reaching beyond the EDM to see the desert vastness. As they spot our stack of coolers along the fence, in they trickle and find Iced Cold Margaritas waiting for them. Every year we go through every drop of beverage we can carry out there, usually in under an hour or two. Hosted by Camp Threat.\r\n\r\nBring a cup and witty banter. Join us at the fence.\r\n\r\nAnd, YES, most definitely, Daft Punk will be playing.",

        "description": "Start your evenings with the most intense laughter you can experience. We laugh for no reason, other than for exercise, and health. Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits. Find much more info online by searching on Laughter Yoga, but come! Enjoy!",

There will be an exploration on the difference between the Indian Hinduism (Polytheistic) & Chinese Taoism (Monotheistic) theories and how we can integrate these two philosophies into our daily spiritual practice to empower ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe discussion will then be followed by a 2 hour Yoga & Qi Gong class which will blend together the elements of ancient India (Yoga) and China (Qi Gong) to provide a dynamic moving meditation focused on providing a balance of both Yang (active) and Yin (passive) elements, that will conclude with a healing Yoga Nidra (conscious deep sleep) meditation - leaving you empowered, focused, and energized - ready for the burn and the new year. \"",

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll provide sticks for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain health through LSA, and vowed if he was ever freed, he’d dedicate his life to spread its benefits, with the proviso that no trainer could ever charge for it. (Like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, moved to Southern California, and taught classes of students and future teachers. Today, weekly classes abound in So Cal, around the US, and the world.

Mead is the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man & we aim to share with you how easy it is to make at home. A honey based wine, mead requires a very small investment on your part. The variations of style are endless as you can make mead with fruit, ciders, herbs, different kinds of honey, dry or sweet, (i.e. has remaining sugar),  bubbly, (like sparkling wine), or still. We will explain how to make it, where to get it, and even have demo equipment available. 21+ and over can sample different varieties we've made and brought to share. You will come away with an understanding of:   Early Discoveries of Mead,  Mead in Religion and Culture, & the Techniques of Making Mead: -Overall concepts that mixing water, honey and yeast starts a reaction to convert the sugars in the honey to alcohol and release carbon dioxide gas. -The equipment needed such as a 1, 3 or 5 gallon water bottles, airlocks, tubes to siphon off the mead from the ‘lees,’ (sediment at the bottom of the fermentation container), bottles, and a few other items such as cleanser to keep everything clean. -Selections of honey to make mead and how the type of honey influences the end result flavor and the same for yeast selection. -Selections of ‘adjuncts’ which influence the flavor of your mead: the addition of spices such as cloves or cinnamon (known as metheglin), or the addition of fruits such as raspberries or strawberry (melomel).  We will finish up with tasting different styles! Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!",

I have 18 years coaching authentic self-expression, including 4 TEDx talks. 22 years studying people / human interaction via songwriting (and expressing my findings artfully). 28 years as a performer in various capacities, especially singing. In my career I've presented music and talks for over 100,000 people. Also, I've spent the last full year doing a deep dive into femininity/polarity studies. I am an advocate for men being empowered (especially as women claim their power more and more), and attaining the capacity to leave legacies. This includes knowing how to navigate matters of the heart. Overall, I really LOVE showing men how to feel happy and free professionally, publicly, and personally by learning how to express themselves authentically. So much of this revolves around a man's ability to limit drama and distraction in his life.",

We'll sense and feel the way that energy moves through the body with Qi Gong practice. We'll explore somatic training and the Body/Mind practices of Developmental Movement and Experiential Anatomy. We'll investigate our relationship to form, space, and each other through Viewpoints Space Awareness and Mudra Space Awareness. \r\n\r\nThis class is a laboratory where we'll be working with the energy that animates our bodies. We'll be exploring how energy moves when the body moves and how mind can direct energy. We'll learn to harness the power of the breath and focus of the mind to attain higher performance outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe work is toward attaining a greater depth of expression of personal energy, achieving grace and ease in a variety of movement patterns, developing an equanimity of all body parts as initiators and supporters of movement in space, and gaining the ability to dance ecstatically with great amounts of energy without loss of awareness of where you are and what is around you. \r\n\r\nEveryone is welcome from dancers seeking to bring contemplation into their dance - to those wishing to bridge their sitting practice to their walking meditation practice to the rest of their active lives - to people who have never danced or meditated before.",

        "description": "Imagine, you’ve just met someone you’re highly attracted to. You’re having a wonderful conversation and you feel the excitement building in your chest.  You’re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It’s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you’ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we’re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we’re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your “fuck yes!” and your “Oh no!” and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don’t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!",

Now a part of the Cult of the Magic Lady!\r\n\r\nCome plop yourself down on a couch... or on a fellow burner... or on a fellow burner ON a couch..  Enjoy fresh popped corn in the middle of nowhere.  Programming varies but, with a library of terabytes of entertainment onhand, is bound to be... entertaining to someone.  Bring a friend!  Or two!  Maybe even three, but let's not overdo it, we usually don't have THAT much room.\r\n\r\nEveryone has to grow tired of nonstop raving now and again (I think... Do you?  Honestly, I wouldn't know... Never really was my thing...  Which is why I run a theater... in a desert..  Oh crap, I think I may have gotten off track...) so take a night off and JOIN US...\r\n\r\nFree intoxicants for the kids!  (No, not really... I'm actually just amazed at how many characters I'm allowed to type in this section...  Really.  I've only just passed the halfway point.  Isn't that nuts?  How are you to be expected to come up with so much to say, really...?)\r\n\r\nPrevious nights have included: Dude Night (Tron, The Fisher King, The Big Lebowski), Musical Night (Repo: The Musical, Tommy, Suck)... Some nights we don't even HAVE themes!  (Because, you know... Burning Man...  Plans vaporize!)\r\n\r\nSo be sure to visit us at some point in your travels.  You can also get yourself loaded at the Koi Lounge, and of course HAVE AN ABORTION... Or two... Or three! (You slut, but we don't do shame because.... What's the point?)",

By holding, rocking, and cradling each other, a direct path is formed to deep and visceral experiences of nurturance. Some of the movements we do induce mutual trance states by using repetitive circular motion. A hug that evolves into a spiral that is so safe and supported that we enter graceful states of consciousness. If you are looking for ways to enhance your relationship with your partner, this may be useful. Relating in non-verbal, non-linear fashion can have an effect of breaking through barriers of relating on new and different levels. People report that using these methods deepens and re-invigorates their relationship.",

The huge attendance last year truly showed the diversity of our community on the Playa. This annual event features music, libations and snacks and is a great place to reconnect with friends and/or a hottie from the past---or even a new hottie for 2015---right at the beginning of the week. It's also a great place to post & promote your own LGBTQQ-themed events for the week on our events board, so bring flyers and info of your events.",

        "description": "we're very excited as this will be Playfully Yours 14th year on the playa. We have expanded our play area with more than doubling the size. We offer an outdoor play area, a covered open area, and new to our camp, an enclosed area offering privacy out of sight from passerbyers. We invite everyone but especially beginners and those curious about BDSM play to come and play in a safe, non-pressured, and supervised environment to learn and experience dungeon play. As our name implies (Playfully Yours), we focus on the lighter, more sensual, and playful side of BDSM. The dungeon is well equipped with 3 St Andrews Crosses, a seated cross, 2 benches, a kneeling spanking/flogging bench, a standing spanking/flogging bench, a suspension station, 2 padded saw horses, a standing/kneeling stock, an 8' chain spider web, and a petting cage. We offer several toys to come and experience and play with such as feathers, a variety of floggers, paddles, crops, pinwheels, fur gloves, and a violet wand. Our personnel are available to provide instruction and demonstration on the safe use of the equipment and will supervise all play. We also have a lounge area where you can relax and meet our campmates while checking out our camp. The lounge has a spanking bike, a corn hole bean bag game, lounge chairs, a mini bar serving our cherry bombs for those over 21 years old with id, as well as, a spinning wheel to facilitate participation.  There are also daily scheduled classes with demonstrations and audience participation. We'll have an Intro Into Dungeon Play and a Shibari Sexy Body Rope Tying classes. We also have gifting of collars, paddles and patches. Our hours accommodate those coming in an play both day and night, generally from noon to about 3 am.",

The default model for relationship in our society, monogamy, makes explicit the underlying belief that Freedom and Love exist in opposition with each other.\r\n\r\nBut what if our desire for Freedom in relationship is covering a deeper desire, namely that we want to know, and be assured, that we can speak and honor our deepest Truths, and Desires, even, and especially, while in we are in Loving committed partnerships. So what if, instead of talking about Freedom, we talked how to create a relationship where it's safe to speak our Truths, including all of our desires (even for others), and know that we will still be Loved?\r\n\r\nJoin us for a conversation about how open relationships can be created from a place deep Love and commitment to Truth.",

You must be 21 or over to Party here and we do ask for and check ID's (it's always good to carry your ID while at Burning Man). We start the mornings with Bloody Mary's at 9:00am until we run out. We then dispense our \"Tiki Punch\" (yes, it has a punch) well into the night. Nudity is never required but at Party Naked Tiki Bar it is rewarded. This year we have 1800+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that \"do it\" (get naked). Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited touching is prohibited. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day. Be LNT friendly and bring your own cup please.",

Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT!\r\n\r\n Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races!\r\n\r\nPEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. \r\n\r\nWe also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa!",

This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. \r\n\r\nUnder the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject.\r\n\r\nWe maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited all over the playa.\r\n\r\nThe pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999. The pinhole came about of the desire of four first time participants to contribute in a unique and lasting way to the ephemeral pleasures of the playa.\r\n\r\nAs we have grown, so too has our belief that this device is the reason that we make our annual pilgrimage. As we have evolved, so too has the camera, not only in functional and technical capabilities but also in its role as a seed of meaningful engagement with other participants.",

Next year, we want to add more Ploems, scattered as Easter Eggs around the Playa. Forms available to write and submit your own ploem 24 hours a day, and we'll post it on the Ploetry website.\r\nWrite a ploem, build an installation, or both - we'll show you how. This is a workshop - all building is done off-season, off-playa. But take your inspiration to write your Ploem while in Black Rock City! *** Please note that this event takes place at the tower in the Cafe, not the tower on the open playa. *** MWF 11-noon, TT 5pm-6m, in the large Ploetry installation in Center Camp Cafe.",

Do you want to reduce the amount of recycling you will have to pack out? Start by bringing all of your beverages in aluminum cans. Follow that by separating your your aluminum cans and other recyclables from any landfill trash. Bring your aluminum cans to Black Rock City Recycle Camp. We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is \"Open\" and ready to accept your aluminum cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. You can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and Black Rock City..!!!",

        "description": "RED NOSE DISTRICT presents PEDALBUMP Demolition Derby Races under the Big Top Circus tent. Is it a race? Is it a demolition derby? IT's BOTH! Or Neither. Several Riders PEDAL AND DRIVE head-to-head around a 60 x 90 foot track under the gorgeous CIRCUS TENT with LIGHTS, MUSIC and ANNOUNCERS! Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT! Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races! PEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. We also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa! GUEST HOST CREWS SCHEDULED: GATE  CREW is Representing on Tuesday night. MYSTIKAL MISFITS are representing on Wednesday night!",

We begin with a deep dive into our truth—our true nature—which is simply a letting go and a knowing of who we always already are, beyond our ideas about ourselves and others: a simple direct undeniable knowing of our clear deep heart-mind-being. \r\nWe will ground ourselves in this present moment and connect with our higher self and cultivate our intentions, desires, and wishes for the night.\r\nUsing movement, stillness, and humor we bring awareness and acceptance to ourselves and our conditioning.\r\nThrough simple spontaneous body movements you embody and express your truth(s) and your true being. \r\nFinally we move into connecting and relating with each other while staying connected with our self. This process will be facilitated with some simple relating exercises and is a chance to see through our ego and conditioned habitual ways of relating and being. We invite a sense of humor to simply seeing ourselves and the conscious and unconscious games we play. \r\nBringing awareness to our patterns opens the possibility of playing with them and responding from our clear deep heart mind space, rather than reacting. Respond from awareness rather than react from habits. We live from our true nature rather than our conditioning. We dance.",

        "description": "\"What is Rootism?\" My response to this in short: Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs. These truths are different for everyone based on how they we raised and what we resonate with at the time of our learning. As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.\r\n\r\nRootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.\r\n\r\nAs an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.\r\n\r\nThe 8 Principles of Rootism:\r\n\r\n∞Principles of Rootism™\r\n\r\n1. Release what no longer serves - nurture yourself & ground yourself\r\n2. Embrace a Creative Vision\r\n3. Move forward on your journey -Take Steps Fearlessly\r\n4. Empathize and Feel what is going on within you & others\r\n5. Motivate yourself & others by Truth – Check the Ecology of the Whole\r\n6. Bridge the Mind & the Heart\r\n7. Evolve a Pro-Sociality Lifestyle & Manifest a Greater Humanity - help others and give back\r\n8. Revolutionize - Reveal Yourself! Open UP! Inner Knowing is Outer Showing\r\n\r\nThe acronym is \"Remember\"",

The Butterfly symbolizes the Universal Spiritual knowledge and deep Wisdom, and creates its life in the perfect alignment of non-attachment, in a dance of flow and Ease. It has a life filled of transformation, from the day of birth until re-birth, between stages, outer and inner form, with ease and grace moving further, without attaching to its old shape, heart wide open for the life in front of Her. This Yogic Journey is dedicated for you to connect with YOUR inner Butterfly, through a travel of transformation, through your body and senses.

We’ll ask insightful questions of our guests in hopes to get them thinking about the lives and personalities that inspired our beloved camp theme. Also, we value Radical Inclusion and it is our hope to build a cohesive and connected neighborhood. In an attempt to establish community, we’ll promote our first happy hour as a “get to know your neighbors” event.

(yes that pot of gold we are looking for at the end of those playa rainbows!) In this space of curiosity, experimentation and practice, YOU WILL LEARN the emerging art of SUBTLE COMMUNICATION. You will be able to describe your month in Bali in seven (7) words or less in a way that creates more understanding, more curiosity and, yes, more intimate connection (every time) than your 90 minute slide show and endless stories. Really... \r\nAnswer the tiresome question \"How are you?\" in three (3) words that will say more, build immediate trust and help you to purge more friends on facebook than ever before! We all have the ability to 'know' more without using the left side of our brain. We just aren't so practiced. So, with a bit of science, a measure of technique, the willingness to try a 'different way' and a whole workshop of practice! we will be ready to immediately upgrade any relationship, including the one with the hottie you will meet tonight outside the Pleasure Dome!

We will bring something to identify the \"meat\" and identify Trustable Slut Members.\r\n\r\n# 1 rule of SWAP Meat is\r\nyou bring someone AWESOME\r\nto SWAP Meat.\r\n\r\nWe want to be introduced to more amazing people who want to meet fun, playful, and open women, who are in alignment with our values.\r\n\r\nBring someone who you would recommend to date your best friend. Bring someone who is \"available\" to date. Bring someone who has good boundaries and knows how to communicate. Bring someone who YOU are 100% okay with sharing.\r\n\r\nWho NOT to bring:\r\n-Some random person off the playa\r\n-Someone who is overly eager to hook-up (aka desperate).\r\n-Someone who isn't emotionally available or at least self-aware.\r\n\r\nOfficial Meat Policy:\r\n\r\n1) Meat can be of any gender.\r\n2) We encourage \"available\" meat. That word has many interpretations...it is whatever it means to you. However, here are some ways it means to us:\r\n+ is single or in an open relationship.\r\n+ their relationship agreements allow for dating.\r\n+ has time to date, meaning not just interested in hooking-up.\r\n+ has experience in our or some other community of sexy tribe.\r\n+ has emotional intelligence and communication skills.\r\n\r\n*NOTE: We are open to all gender orientations and sexual orientations. We are LGBTQ friendly.",

The fear of expressing all our feelings diminishes, freeing us to make a genuine choices about how we act. Unspoken positive and negative feelings can create blocks in our relationships with friends, colleagues and loved ones.Through experiencing the AUM, relating becomes clearer, more honest and more fun. the AUM also allows you to reclaim to joy of simply being alive.Bring a pillow or cushion",

This often requires a willful transformation of ourselves — a creative shape-shifting — so that we see the world with new eyes, new senses, a new consciousness. It is only in this way that a new world reveals itself — as strange, yes, but perhaps also closer to world in which we dream.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, TEDx BlackRockCity will be an opportunity to open and reflect ourselves in new ways, to a new world, in which we are all transformed by ideas that matter.",

Harness the wisdom of the body and the physical sensations of love to deepen trust, strengthen communications, and create a powerful shared vision for your love relationship.   Discover ancient Yogic, Tantric, and Taoist exercises that will allow you to gain deep insight into your relationship and see your partner in a whole new light, whether you just met on the playa or renewing your vows on your 40th anniversary. You will experience your partner’s love and trust in a new and profound way. Learn how to use these powerful skills and movements to create a new and exciting level of intimacy that deepens the physical, spiritual, and emotional aspects of your sacred connection.  We will explore couple-hood as a yogic path to realization, letting go of the mind and surrendering to the heart through your lover. It is a practice of using your two-ness to realize oneness.  Yoga and Qigong are like brother and sister. \r\n\r\nBoth are esoteric, alchemical practices that were created for self-realization, with exercise being a secondary benefit. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful compliment to a vigorous yoga practice. Both practices have a common source, Neolithic shamanic practices, and both are ancient books of wisdom written in the language of the body. We'll physically explore the connection between these 2 books of wisdom within the context of your love relationship. We are channeling the sexual and creative energies of the body through visualization, movement, ritual, and breath, not sexual activity. Tantric Qigong is an intimate practice of being gentle with oneself and weaving one's own sexual energy, becoming truly receptive to one's own body dialogue.",

        "description": "\"Where are the positive archetypes of feminine power? Kali, who cuts off your head? Hera, who is the god form of holly homemaker: basically “Zeus’ wife” with a goddess-sized jealous streak? Wonder Woman, who battles evil but has no family and no love in her life? It’s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who’s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nLearn how to harness the dual feminine forms and dual masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone.  For Men and Women who want to bring their full spiritual presence into the material world and be the bridge between our present reality and the future vision only you can see.\"",

Is it ever really simple?  “The Game” requires a high degree of interactivity among all those involved, even those walking by may become drawn into the action and be participants. “The Game” has a tendency to create possibilities where there were once boundaries.  Choices where there were once obstacles.  “The Game”: the love child of truth or dare, charades, post office, twister, spin the bottle, and American's Got talent.. \r\n“The Game” is perfect for letting that INNER freak come out. Watch what happens when permission is given to the darker, more playful side of one's self. That part that stays just out of sight, watching from the sideline, wanting to take part, but doesn't due to social constraint or peer reprisal.\r\n“The Game” is both a game of chance and boundaries.  Winning is all a matter of perspective. Everyone wins with the upside of personal insight, everyone loses what may have been a self-limiting perspective.  A new episode with each draw is guaranteed to amaze and astound!",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator.  When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience.  Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want.  No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options.  We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave.  We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun.  Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience.  Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense.  If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

        "description": "There are many things you 'could' do, but there's nothing you 'should' do. I suspect there's no such thing as a 'should'. A should is a 'could' with shame smuggled on top of it. Come explore shame and its cousins: guilt, envy, anger and jealousy. All these emotions have one thing in common, they usually hide their tracks and are hard to admit. Learn to transcend your shame with cutting edge subjective tools. We'll investigate the nature of shame & shaming, look at the adaptive advantages of them and how they serve & do not serve our development.\r\n\r\nJoin love coach Annie Lalla for some powerful exercises that will help you move beyond past shames and show you how desist from laying down new ones. This is a forum to discuss how to experience our emotions, especially the difficult ones, so they stop haunting your psyche.  You will leave shameless or at least shamelessly.",

Our team will have food and beverages for all,  please come and bring a friend to honor the loss of the bands tour manager Dennis Sheehan.  Drummer Larry Mullin JRs father passed away this year also.  Last year Bono had a bike wreck in NYC and sufferd many injurys and is unable to play the guitar on this years tour,  lead guitarist \"The Edge\" fell off the stage in Canada this year and was hurt also.  The burning of the art piece will lift the bad luck the band has had to endure and also honor the memories of those who have pass away.   We are going to produce a video of the event for the U2 nation to share in the event on youtube.  Thank you,  Viper.",

        "description": "Imagine, you’ve just met someone you’re highly attracted to. You’re having a wonderful conversation and you feel the excitement building in your chest.  You’re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It’s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you’ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we’re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we’re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your “fuck yes!” and your “Oh no!” and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don’t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!",

Vinyasa movements are smoothly flowing and almost dance-like, with synchronized breath and movements. Vinyasa has both mental and physical benefits. Physically, sweat expels toxins and re-energizes your body and can be an easy to challenging physical workout, mostly depending on you and where you take your practice. Mentally, the synchronized breathing relaxes your mind and helps to release any blockage of energy flow throughout your body.",

Are you over people asking why your body looks the way it does? Are you interested in creating real safe spaces for people whether they fit in the binary or not? Are you troubled by cultural appropriation on playa and the way some folks are treated as other or freaks in a way that doesn't feel good? Then this workshop is for you. This workshop is also for you if you want to delve into the intersections of race, gender, class and how these identities affect our experience at BM and beyond. Many of us come to playa to be free and our full liberated selves yet when we pass through the gate we have not dropped our baggage of racism, transphobia, sexism, abelism, and classism at the gate.

Men, pay homage to the superior sex from Paradise Island and have an opportunity to atone for the sins of men-kind by receiving punishments and participating in Amazon bondage games (confess your sins while tied in her golden lasso). Bring your favorite submissive of any gender but keep in mind this is a FEMDOM event, no male tops. Male switches must be in “sub mode.” Also, enjoy our Erotic Superhero Bar, including some very special explicit “shots.” Get certified as a cocksucker, or force some straight boys to suck strap-on!",

        "description": "The Zendo is a community outreach project at Burning Man that offers education and psychological support, with the goal to help reduce the potential harms involved in drug use. Volunteers provide peer-to-peer harm reduction support for individuals having a difficult drug-related experience and who don't require medical care. Guests are sometimes actively on substance, and other times are seeking integration support, or education about the risks involved in drug use. We staff the space 24/7 with trained mental health and medical professionals who provide oversight, as well as individuals experienced in crisis response.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to come to the training to learn more about volunteering, it will take place at Something Freaky This Way Foams, near 2:00&G, on Tuesday September 1 at 11AM. \r\n\r\nThe four principles of psychedelic harm reduction include: \r\n\r\n1. Create a safe space - If someone is having a challenging experience try to move them into a comfortable, warm, and calm environment. If possible, try to avoid noisy or crowded spaces. Ask what would make them most comfortable. Offer blankets and water. \r\n\r\n2. Sitting, not guiding - Be a calm presence of acceptance, compassion, and caring. Promote feelings of trust and security. Let the person's unfolding experience be the guide. Don't try to get ahead of their process. Explore distressing issues if they want, but know that simply being with the person is supportive and talking may not be helpful.\r\n\r\n3. Talk through, not down - Invite the person to explore what's happening and encourage them to try not to resist it. Remind them that they are safe. \r\n\r\n4. Difficult is not the same as bad - challenging experiences can wind up being our most valuable and lead to learning and growth. Help the person integrate the experience, and remind them the experience will continue to unfold.",
