        "description": "The Temple of the Deep is a sanctuary for grief, love, and introspection, formed beneath a massive black stone that appears to hover above participants. This dark, fractured element symbolizes the weight of loss and the strength found in healing, inspired by kintsugi, where brokenness is embraced and honored. Seven narrow entrances guide visitors through the journey of mourning, leading to a central gathering space mirroring BRC's layout. Alcoves and chapels offer solitude and remembrance, while the seamless integration with the desert transforms sorrow into connection, grounding participants in shared reflection.",

One for compliments. Together, they offer the full spectrum of what it means to be human.\n\nThe Complaint Box is a place to release what feels heavyâquiet truths, uncomfortable thoughts, the parts of us we usually keep hidden. Itâs not about negativity. Itâs about honesty. About letting the shadow breathe.\n\nThe Compliment Box is for the soft things we notice but rarely sayâmoments of beauty, small joys, gentle recognitions. Itâs a way of splashing whispers of light into the world, with no need for a recipient. Just a raised frequency.\n\nEach day on playa, a single anonymous submission from each box is shared on two nearby chalk boardsâone from the shadow, one from the light. The pairing becomes a mirror. A soft echo. An invitation to see yourself in someone elseâs words.\n\nThis isnât about fixing.\nItâs about feelingâtogether, in public.\nBecause honesty takes courage.\nEvenâespeciallyâwhen no one knows itâs you.\n\nIt takes bravery to put something real into a shared spaceâ\nto let your truth exist where others might read it,\nfeel it,\nrecognize themselves in it.\n\nThis is a space for that kind of openness.\nNot performance.\nNot perfection.\nJust truth, offered bravely.",

Their escape pod crash-lands on this forsaken landâa moon of an unknown planet. They are thrown to the back of the pod against the locked hatch doors. The pod hull is perforated by numerous gamma-radiating shards, making its atmosphere increasingly toxic, as the pod AI companion's worried PSAs keep warning them. Their only path is forward, through the pod's cupola and outside. If they succeed, their only chance to survive is to brave the desolate playa and its strange inhabitants.",

An opportunity for spiritual evolution from outdated habits, shedding outgrown skins in cycles of death and renewal, and finding an inner anchor amidst any storm. It is critical to remain grounded as change is challenging, yet essential for shift and growth. Snakes are keen, cunning, yet ruthless when provoked, and act as divine messengers and guardians of sacred places. They are revered for their charm, intelligence, perception, and healing abilities and intuition. No matter how intense the storm, or constricted we feel, the grip will release, the spirals will lose momentum and eventually still. The wisdom is in the eye of your storm. Trust the ride, listen for the lessons, and harmony and peace will find you.",

The piece is a collection of 155 faux stained glass panels depicting images of canonical pieces from past Burning Man events. The panels are presented in 31 pentagonal lanterns that are in turn arranged in rings of concentric pentagons. The project is also an assertion that the tradition of Burning Man art is an interesting and bold artistic movement in its own right; something that should be taken as seriously by critics and art historians as the notable art movements of the 20th century.",

By presenting an entrance with no true destination, it questions the nature of expectation and immediacy. Not every hidden space holds a secret, and not every thrill waits behind a closed door. We also wanted to share a bit more new context at our project. Evgenii is a European science-based artist with a strong academic background, and together we're aiming to bring a rare example of contemporary interactive art rooted in the European school â something that's almost absent at Burning Man and rarely seen in the U.S. outside of New York.\r\n\r\nOur installation will feature layered interaction scenarios involving sensors, embedded systems, and responsive behaviors. The piece is designed to engage participants on multiple sensory and emotional levels, and we believe it will bring something truly new and exciting to the playa experience.",

Standing at 96 inches tall, the structure features reflective acrylic surfaces on three sides, a red acrylic door, and a skylight that casts a subtle glow. Inside, yarn and resin elements create a textured, immersive interior. As visitors express themselves audibly, light pulses in response, projecting into the sky. Inspired by grief and cosmic connection, the installation transforms personal emotions into a shared, luminous experience, symbolizing the echoes of human expression reaching beyond the physical realm.",

Inside the sail, use steering station, periscope, and wonder at odd furnishings, gauges, controls. Illusion is the ship crew may not be entirely human or from a different time/dimension.

Something stronger.  Something louder.  Taziii fuses raw mechanical power with elemental grace.\r\nHer every step activates hidden MIDI pressure sensors, triggering immersive light and soundscapes created by the legendary Bert manymanyhaha. As wind turns to motion and motion becomes music, Taziii transforms art into entityâa desert-born biomech with something to say.\r\n\r\nShe doesnât crawl.

Some ribs will have Plexi glass to add colors to reflect. Silk fabric on the skirt add visual flow and movement. The cantilevered heart with strings appears as if floating and moving. \r\n\r\nAt night, the Ballerina will be surrounded by solar firefly lights portraying dancing in a twinkle garden in the middle of la playa. The heart LED colors mimics fire & serves as a focal point for wondering souls in the playa at night.",

Surrounding the chapel are flags and a graveyard, leading visitors to the entrance with ominous warnings. In a near-future society where political and religious zealotry intertwine, judgment is no longer private but a public spectacle.

Silhouette symbols cut into the sides will allow a variety of lights to come through.  Four independent 8-10' tall structures will circle the main sculpture. These four structures will have wind instruments that both the Playa wind and participants will play.\n\nAbout once an hour after sunset, lights will travel from the base to the falcon's torso and then out to each of the 12 wings.

Five concentric rings, up to 20ft in diameter, chaotically spin around a central spherical infinity mirror resembling a black hole, which is held perfectly still by a beautiful trick of mathematics. Beneath the rings, is a partially enclosed space surrounded by shimmering walls of light - a space to reflect, a space to wonder, or a space to dance. The entire sculpture is also audio reactive: when it hears a nearby musical presence like an art car, it converts into a cosmological dance floor that pulses to the beat!",

You find you have been transported into a cozy raccoon world of fluffy \"trash\", homey art, and a portal to another dimension. There is a hole in the side that you crawl through to find a cushy space to chill in a raccoon's home. We invite participants to live like raccoons for a few moments and experience what their lives may be like inside a dumpster. Many connections will be made as participants marvel at the portal (infinity mirror) and cuddle with the trash pillows. We welcome all woodland and trashy creatures (but leave no trace)!",

Often interpreted as romantic love, it also means self love, community connection, and finding harmony within oneself. The Lovers (T4T) is about trans love, community support,  celebrating trans beauty and joy in a world that tries to erase it.

The face of the Queen will be made of felt and other fabric arts, adorned with lights and face jewels.\r\n\r\nShe will have earrings that BRC citizens will be able to swing and rest in. She will have hair that will be full and soft, crocheted in different lengths and textures from chunky yarn that is bouncy and colorful. \r\n\r\nYour eyes will be drawn upwards to see a Crown adorning her head. The Crown will shine with LEDs and reflective pieces.\r\n\r\nThe Queen will also have cornrows on the side of her head that will be long enough to allow for jump rope and double dutch. These cornrows act as rungs that BRC citizens are invited to climb so they may reach the crown.",

By giving these looming perils a tangible, physical form, we hope to spark honest conversations about how to address them before they become overwhelming. Whether thinking of the COVID pandemic or the war in Ukraine (which began in 2014), acknowledging threats is the first step in transforming them. Although the cloud warns of instability, it also offers a gathering point where we can find camaraderie, and hopeâreminding us that, together, we can adapt, resist, and shape a better future.",

The artwork juxtaposes harsh desert with an implied tranquil aquatic oasis, organic life with recycled metal forms. Light, sound, and the arrangement of objects create a sense of unseen water, shifting the viewer's focus from the tangible to the felt, the internal.

As one moves inward, a third layer of the color story reveals itself along the inner surface of the structure. It's a play between the muscularity of the framing and the delicate dancing radiance of this inner sanctuary. \n\nLike the humble snail, we search for ways to carry our sanctuary with us. The spiraling shell shows how we too can transform our barriers into windows of beauty.

It's meant to portray a bizarre machine from an unknown time period with an unknown function, and also evoke whimsy and absurdity. \r\n\r\nIn an alternate history, when oil was first being extracted, the explosive gases that pooled above it were seen as a liability. I'm interested in a timeline where these gases were deemed too dangerous to be useful. As such, they were burned off at the extraction site. Over time, bored roughnecks in the field began to build devices to harness this wasted potential. Spinning noisemakers and whistling tubes developed as different sites competed to make the most interesting use of this burning fuel. Eventually artists got involved and an aesthetic developed named propanepunk.",

The insect-like form hints at a post-human archetype, a being not choosing between opposites but holding them both at once. It invites reflection on the paradox of unity through contradiction.",

The space within the petals provides a respite from the harsh Burning Man environment for participants to connect with one another and go within their own hearts and minds.\r\n\r\nThere will be subtle lighting at night illuminating the white (for purity and balance) petals in slowly cycing hues of blue (for willpower), to pink (for compassion), to gold (for wisdom) to create a serene, meditative and transformative atmosphere.

In the center stands a white pillar, representing the culmination of all the shapes and colors, coming together to form white light, or balance.",

Relationshipsâromantic, platonic, or undefinedâare constantly evolving, shifting between closeness and distance, ease and tension. Yet, even as lives diverge, a subtle thread of connection persists. It is a tribute to the profound experience of reconnecting with someone significant, as if no time has passedâreminding us of the beauty and power that lie in these lasting bonds.",

The solids are different sizes, with the smallest easily flipped from side to side by one person and the largest needing more than one person to roll. As the solids move around the playa, they leave their stamp in areas that have accumulated an impermanent layer of dust - until it blows away - evoking the transient nature of life, death, rebirth, and love.",

        "description": "Puzzling Evidence is a striking and thought-provoking art installation designed to express a powerful journey through grief, resilience, and finding beauty in life's unexpected chaos. At its heart is an ordinary kitchen table, transformed into an extraordinary symbol of life reshaped by profound loss. Covered entirely in countless mismatched puzzle pieces, arranged randomly, the piece visually encapsulates the complex and often messy nature of piecing life back together after tragedy.\r\n \r\nIn 2015, the loss of my husband at just 50 years old, followed closely by my mother's passing the next year, left me facing a world that was suddenly unfamiliar and fragmented. Each puzzle piece, sourced from diverse puzzles never intended to align, embodies distinct memories, unexpected challenges, and critical decisions made while navigating the path of healing and rebuilding. Though intentionally mismatched, together the puzzle pieces coalesce into a cohesive, beautiful wholeâillustrating that life's imperfections and fractures don't diminish its inherent beauty. Instead, these flaws amplify our uniqueness and resilience, capturing the profound truth that we are beautifully broken, perfectly imperfect, and extraordinary precisely because of our flaws.\r\n \r\nAdding an interactive dimension to the installation, the table includes subtle LED lighting controlled by an ARM processor connected to radar and microphone sensors beneath its surface. Encircled by chairs adapted for Burning Man's playa environment, the installation \"feels\" joy when people gather nearby, glowing in warm colors, and conveys sadness through cooler hues when isolated. This responsive feature highlights the importance of connection and companionship on the journey toward healing and resilience.\r\n \r\nUltimately, Puzzling Evidence invites contemplation and self-reflection, encouraging viewers to embrace their own life's puzzleâcomplete with gaps, mismatches, and unplanned piecesâand see it as unique and beautiful.",

The artists believe in taking care of our one and only planet, and believe that all people are one race and that we are all in this together. The watch on the dog's collar is set at 11:11, a time of oneness, and a time to send positive energy into the world. The circles stand for community, love, and the reciprocity of life.

Its central spine supports flowing appendages that ripple with the wind, creating an ever-changing, organic motion. By day, it casts shifting shadows on the playa, and by night, its reflective surfaces shimmer subtly with ambient light. Rooted in Chinese philosophy and Daoist principles of flow and harmony, the piece symbolizes adaptability and effortless movement. As a continuation of Magic Jelly (2023), it embodies the beauty of nature's unseen forces, inviting contemplation of balance, impermanence, and interconnectedness.",

Atomic Secrets challenges participants to become something new, as they react to intimate secrets being shared inside. Last year we collected nearly 1500 anonymous secrets at our installation Spiral Of Secrets, and this year we will blow them up! Inside of an 8â x 8â x 8' cube, posters as well as the original cards will be affixed to the walls, and a trippy sound collage of the secrets being read aloud will be playing. Within the reactor core, participants will be asked to reflect on how they have changed over time and what catalyzed their transformation. Outside will be decorated with symbols of atomic imagery. Come inside and have a meltdown, and return to watch it all burn!",

So it is with the Lit Saguaro, a collaboration between welder and ceramicist. It relies on its metal skeleton to hold it aloft, and is at once both sturdy and fragile. It lights the desert night, inspiring Burners to turn up and tune up their light within. May it inspire you to burn bright and long.",

We provide a route map of different bus/mutant vehicle services that might be in service with tentative schedules. As citizens wait for the ride, they can enjoy the comfort of a fur-covered bench and have shade over their heads as they enjoy bike-spotting in the deep playa day and night.\r\n\r\nThe lusty part kicks in at night where once getting closer to the bus stop Barry White and Co. tunes will greet you and make it a perfect sound track for a prolonged wait in a super comfy bus stop! Enjoy the wait!",

Crafted from steel and polycarbonate with textured, sculpted surfaces, it merges industrial presence with surreal elegance. Ropes hang from the fingers, transforming the sculpture into a poetic symbol of tension between control and liberation. Subtle lighting enhances its silhouette by night, while its scale and motion evoke awe and introspection. Fusing contemporary sculpture, technology, and interactive design, Hand of Fate offers a bold and thought-provoking presence on the playa.",

From each vertical post, a mannequin arm extends outward at hand-shaking height, palm open. When touched, the arms sense the participant's heartbeat, triggering light to flow up the cube and into the heart. The heart glows and pulses in real time, visually syncing with the rhythms of those engaged. As more people connect, the lights intensify and evolve, creating a living display of collective energy. The piece explores the idea that, like music, light may also synchronize us, inviting reflection on connection, rhythm, and the unseen pulses that link us together.",

In contrast, the other side of the mural depicts a man in a state of lust or agony, pulled apart by the hands of numerous loversâa metaphor for the overwhelming abundance of potential connections we encounter in modern life. This duality speaks to the power of choice in our journey, honoring both shared intimacy and unapologetic self-indulgence.",

We are beginning to remember and explore a way of being that tend more toward states of FLOW and of PRESENCE. As we remember and re-explore the logic of the DREAMTIME we find again that we are ultimately connected to everything, that we are all unique expressions of Universe, that we are all connected to each other.\r\nAs we re-explore the dreamlike nature of reality, we begin to wonder \"What would it be like to lucid dream this life?\"",

By day, its geometric form casts shifting shadows; by night, it glows with light patterns that echo past interactions. Embedded LEDs respond to remote touch from smaller handheld nodes distributed across the playa. The piece represents memory, time, and interconnectedness, blending ancient materials with futuristic ideas. Built in collaboration with students from Cal Poly Humboldt, Tesseratica invites reflection on how presence and participation shape shared experience.",

Upon entry, one discovers that the hollow interior is lined with quilted natural fabrics. This creates a soft, cocoon-like environment for seekers to rest, dream, whisper, laugh, or simply do nothing.

Named after the Tao Te Ching, participants experience exponential growth. It invites a long-term perspective: What happens when you embrace the vulnerability of imperfection and take a first step? What emerges when you commit to compounding effort day after day, year after year?

        "description": "The installation is composed of matte black poles, each shaped as a rigid parallelepiped and standing between five and six feet tall. Arranged in a loose formation evoking a corridor or fragmented tunnel, the structures inhabit unwarped space with a silent tension. A single edge of each pole emits a soft, shifting glow, subtly disrupting the rigidity of the otherwise austere geometry. Together, they form a tangible manifestation of a threshold in space-time, where the boundaries between time, light, and existence begin to blur, yet the form remains sharply, almost impossibly, clear. The installation invites stillness and motion, perception and reflection, guiding the viewer through a passage between then and now.",

In the 60s and 70s many believed that humanity was on the cusp of The Age of Aquarius, where social justice would prevail, wars would cease, environmental concerns would be paramount, an inequalities would be addressed.\nMany, although not all, now see this as naive optimism, because they believe overall the world and humanity is in a worse position than it was then.\nEach photograph panel is a summary of the thoughts of an individual who remembers that era, with their photograph, and a photo of an object, event, or person which symbolizes the Age of Aquarius, or the loss of this optimism.\nViewers can jot down any thoughts or reactions to the exhibit they might have.",

Two of Runester's unique art/game systems, AstroCraps &  I Ching O-Matic will be installed within the space. The games tabulate the deep complexity of traditional divination within the burner party setting. Burners learn how to participate and compare divination techniques and show others how to do them. Activities can happen day and night at random as well as at specific workshops and scheduled demos.",

The bamboo skeleton and silk pages collide with the wind, and the breath of nature and the tremor of the machine are intertwined. The fragments of the sculpture invite the audience to gaze at the flow of textual energy, but do not provide answers. It uses the breath of wind to fight against the absolute rationality of the digital age. In the interplay of bamboo and silk, it asks how humans can rebuild the poetry of existence between the cracks of reality and illusion.",

A story about transformation, redemption, and second chances. The material has a past: lumber retired from playa duty, supports a structure of about 700 bells made from spent high-pressure tanks, threaded on salvaged wire from earlier BM art. Beneath, fabric covered discarded mattressesâonce bound for the landfillâoffer one final gesture of comfort.\r\n\r\nLike the people who encounter it, like these elements are not perfect or pristine, but made more meaningful by their history.\r\nWind stirs the bells into a constant din that challenges quietâbut invites a different kind of stillness: one found in letting go while staying present.",

The flat platform symbolizes both our desire for order and the inevitability of entropy, echoing the tension between human constructs and the natural world. It stands as a quiet meditation on fragility and resilience.",

The piece encourages burners to stand around it, inviting them to leave behind digital distractions and rediscover the organic wonder of light and metal. The installation is both a homage to the primal allure of fire and a reminder of beauty found in simplicity amidst our technologically driven world.",

Named after the Titan from Greek mythology who held up the sky, the work symbolizes the responsibility we share in protecting vulnerable species. By spotlighting these often-overlooked creatures, Atlas highlights the delicate balance of our ecosystems and encourages reflection on global ecological interdependence.",
