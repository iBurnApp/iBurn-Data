At Spinny's, playfulness reigns through mega-sized playground structures, type-2 fun experiences, and extreme schoolyard games hosted by our Recess Hall Monitors. From 360-degree see-saws and a spinning bar to rope climbs and dance floors, we invite burners to rediscover the thrill of movement on the playa.

As with any true third space, guests can stop by, relax, ask for directions, chat, or PARTICIPATE in one of 3SP's events focusing on all kinds of issues: being introverted on Playa; navigating the world as a stutterer/stammerer; identifying unconscious biases; Native-American appreciation versus appropriation; relaxing with essential oils or a camera obscura mediation; and more. We've been around since 2015 and we've got campers from DC, NYC, Minneapolis, Philly, Portland, LA, and beyond. Come on by!",

Real water drops, sparkling as they fall, slow and then hover in mid-air, each drop contorting before your eyes. If you find yourself stunned by the experience and would like to see it again, no worries -- you can reverse time by turning the knob the other direction, lift the water back into the sky, watch as it absorbs back into the eagles eyes, and then see the same drops fall again.",

We love the multifaceted variety of environments and believe that it makes Illumination Village a unique and delightful place to visit. \n\nCome take a steam during the day and make sure to visit our Fire Art Carnival in the evening. Our Fire pit will be lit up late into the night. \n\nAll are welcome!",

Our core theme is Celebration and Liberation. We are also a European camp, with our burners coming primarily from France, Sweden, Latvia and Spain.

We are a group of queer women/trans/genderqueer/lesbian/bisexual/heterosexual/etc... or folks who are simply as wayward as the playa is dusty. We celebrate sexuality, self exploration, and respect for one's journey through this life. Our goal is to provide a safe(r), brave(r) space that centers queer women, trans folks, and nonbinary identities on and off-playa. We encourage education, participation, inquiry, conversation, and self-reflection. We extend our goals to the greater Black Rock community by hosting workshops and social events.",

This led to the formation of the Black Rock Desert Migratory Bird Refuge (BiRDMBR), a new outpost of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge. \n\nWith the creation of the Black Rock Desert Migratory Bird Refuge, birds will have a home in the Great Basin during their migrations as well as habitat preserved for year round residents including cougars, beavers, badgers. \n\nBiRDMBR plans an extensive permanent Visitor Center with interpretive panels and interactive activities to engage participants of all abilities and ages. \n\nJoin us in our Visitor's Center watering hole and nest for activities like Personalize Your Pee Jug, Bird Bingo, Nature Journaling, and more.",
