        "description": "The piece is inspired by the natural balance of organic and geometric properties in nature. The title refers to a red maple tree, a symbol of endurance and the passing of time. The tower, a blend of gothic and modern technology, is meant to combine these notions. The passage of time is important to me, and whether it is my perspective or an objective truth, society as a whole feels to be entering into a new season. It feels like something is ending, but as we pass from autumn into winter, so follows spring.",

But Chilopod comes with a serious message too.\n\nChilopod asks, \"Are humans the pests or the stewards of Earth?\" When her home planet's ecosystem was collapsing, bio-engineers created intergalactic seed pods to grow in foreign soil, with a mission to encourage emerging civilizations to safeguard the health of their home planets. Chilopod landed in the Black Rock Desert and grew into what we see today, a maturing being just learning to communicate with humans. When visitors slide down her spine we pick up her thought-spores so that we might disseminate her ecological message across the world.",

Inside the hallowed-out head is a place where people can sit. Drawn inside the shell of the head are all kinds of ideas with pictograms depicting ideas that can filter through a person's head.

        "description": "The \"Celestial Whale\" is a large-scale automaton, a simple, human powered machine. It is made of articulated sections, each composed of recuperated materials, suspended inside an icosahedron that represents the Earth. A hand crank generates the whale's movement, making it swim through space. \nA whale is a symbol of peace and tranquillity but also of our fight to combat the dangers menacing the earth and all its inhabitants: climate change, pollution and many others. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, whales are now protected by international law due to individuals coming together to act. This installation demonstrates that an individual can have an impact both on the people around them but also on the planet as a whole.",

She will be made out of reclaimed wood, metal, and hardware recovered from previous Burning Man projects, fences, and construction sites.

Visually, for most of the day the sun creates a colour spectacle and the night a light performance results in an autonomous environment. It becomes the playa in a translated form that's represented as a triangular prism.

When people sit beneath the strings, they feel as though they are inside an instrument and are bathed in peaceful, healing, and grounding vibrations. The strings are anchored on one end by an 18 foot tall, 24 foot wide wooden heart that lights up at night. The strings are anchored on the other end by the True Reflections Palace, an 8'x8' cube with a platform on top where the performer stands to play the instrument, which will glow at night. Inside the palace are mirrors that show the true self. These elements come together to encourage a deep inner-knowing of the self.",

The cards have manifested as portals into feminine wisdom. A host of witches, maidens, mothers, and crones reach out through transcendent images of photographic magic to deliver messages of poetic healing. Four outposts at the four compass directions embody the minor arcana, the characters and scenarios of life's endless stories. At their center are twenty-two doors, each leading inward to the primal light of consciousness by way of the major arcana, the ultimate symbols of life's infinite transformative power. Each sunset calls a mysterious cast of time travelers to light the central fire.",

Bee-hived waitresses serve up grilled cheese sandwiches and top up your coffee with a smile.  Every aspect of the diner \u2013 the sound of dishes clinking, the 1940's music, a flickering neon sign all embody the all-night diner experience. An oasis for any weary traveler who discovers us in deep playa who needs a stool to sit on and a hot meal.",

Participants live life live (not a typo). One needs to live, but also to do it live & not in a recorded or fake fashion. Too often burners live outside of their reality and not in a present way. Rene Magritte's surrealist art makes the participant question their reality. The text communicates what it is (art) but also what it is not (not a NFT of art). While art exists, it doesn't exist until someone creates some type of physical form. NFTs exist but not in physical form, yet this piece exists as a NFT upon being video'd & made into a NFT, which means what it isn't becomes what it is.",

As a movement, Afrofuturism envisions 'tomorrow' by exploring cultural and design aesthetics between the arts, history, science-fiction, and politics from African and African diasporic lens. The Ancient Egyptians and Nubians believed that the sun was a deity, Ra, and had metaphysical powers as the giver of life on Earth and creator of the universe. The design is futuristic with clean lines, subtle angles, and large panels which also give it a 'megalithic' appearance.",

Inspired by Aetherius, the Greek God of the upper air and light, this sculpture can be played by both humans and the elements. A hexagonal prism of 120 strings comes alive with ethereal music through interaction with desert sun and wind. Sound of Aetherius hugs us with the tonal textures of the desert, and allows all of us to be musicians. It asks us to bow our heads to nature and the magical gifts she can bring us.",

Backlit screens will demonstrate the moire pattern as the outer screen rotates around the pipe. There will also be a zoetrope built into the pipe and will have a viewing piece that will give it a old time peep show feel.  The illustrations on the zoetrope will be done by several different artists and we will be able to change the art easily during the event.\nPipe Dreams is an attempt to create a new piece that has the feel of machines that were made in the late 1800's.",

He playfully refused to let anyone see inside.

No's are not not by nature negative but should not be vague or carelessly wrought. People can spin the letters how they want, or the wind will. When The Fragile NO is approached two bright security flood lights will go on. It will be obvious they have just approached a big NO. If they try to climb on it they will find that this NO is actually fragile and might not last through the whole burn. What will the Burner community do with it? Will they care that it says Fragile all over it? Will it cause them to reflect on the other NO's in their life? Will they want to stand up for NOs big and small that they value?",

Various patinas and other metal types add texture and color to help define the patterns, designs and motifs that make up the panels. Fine details to appreciate by day will be lit at night by colored LED spotlights to create infinitely variable patterns. Wind-driven outstretched wings will rotate around the center pole, giving the sculpture a kinetic aspect. Flame effects will be at the top, on the wings and on the ground.",

It acts as a place to connect to one another & witness the desert as universe. The soft-scape provided affords a place for participants to sit, climb, & play.

By night, lighting that cycles through the color spectrum augments the color and shadow on the structure creating an ever-changing form that challenges the predictability of the fractal pattern. Climbing the structure reveals an interior space to rest and gather. The space is filled with monochromatic light that contrasts the constantly changing light of the playa.",

We make our way past crowds of similarly effected people and find ourselves in front of a strange structure. We push the activation device and the art piece comes to life. Multiple pyramid faces of various themes light up in individual sequences and chimes sound above our heads!  A fish, rocket ship, palm tree, (an eggplant?), a planet surround by stars.....why so many different thoughts and meanings? This is something we'll discuss for the rest of the night.",

Holding a balloon to light the way, this sculpture is barely there, until nightfall when colorful light emanates from within the face, hands, and base of the ghost. Visitors to the deep playa will find this funny character by the light of his solar LED balloon, looking for the party.\nThis artwork represents our memories, loved, past and future. The embodiment of the ghost is a metaphor for the things we often can't pin down, the places we long to visit, things altered by time or things that have drifted away. This ghost is waiting in the dust to remember you, and show you the way back to a different time.",

The purpose of my project is to give participants an opportunity to reflect and contemplate on all the darkness and traumatic experiences from the past few years.  And it is our responsibility to stare directly at the darkness, accept the tragedies, process our emotions, and fight against the injustices.",

Each tree stands as a unique sculpture, an individual entity, made more beautiful by its initial struggle for sun, the resistance to gravity, and ultimately the sculpting by blazing wildfire heat.  \n\nThe installation poses questions regarding humanities ongoing relationship to the element of fire. Is FIRE friend or foe; teacher, healer, provider or malevolent force? Accompanying  the grove an interactive altar provides a space for 2D art and written word responses to the questions.",

Colorful fabric pieces flutter from the canopy in the desert air during the day. At night, a rainbow of lights frame the playa. Laughter, beats, fire-breathing art cars provide the soundtrack. People are drawn to this resting place, whether by the white steed of a bed in the austere desert & bit of shade provided during the day or by the dreamy lights of the bed at night. While there, people pile onto the bed &, inspired by the surroundings, they share their dreams with others. 'Dreaming' invites all people to pause in their journey. And here, people don't sleep to dream but wake to live their dreams.",

When we depart our beloved desert tired and dusty, filled with more happy memories than we came with, there is also a joy in coming home to what and who we've left behind in the default. \n\nTwo dogs await your approach, tails gently wagging, greeting you with enthusiasm. You may have to leave your furry friends behind to venture to Black Rock City, but Mushu and Ginger are here to give you a bit of the comfort of home.",

When a sound \u2013 man-made or natural - occurs in the vicinity of SKUM, the lightning strikes cease \u2013 only starting back up once the quiet serenity returns.

But how do you repair a broken heart?\nSentinels protect the heart with vigilant eyes.  Within these Guardians, you can research the artifacts of pain, loss, guilt and shame.  Each token is a memorial to a heart wrenching story.  The Guardians turn these artefacts into bricks used to protect the heart by building a wall around it.  But while walls protect, they cannot heal a broken heart.  \nWhen it is time to heal, we turn to nature.  The heart's forest feeds the heart.  The larger-than-life rotating heart knows what medicine it needs- what medicine you need: love, connection, gratitude.  Each tree will help you on your journey.",

The sign is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 LED bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power). The piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORiNG sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With four 500-watt speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.",

In the center is a 12 stepped pyramid 20' square 12' high with space inside for people to hear the Codes of Creation and for connecting to Self within the Divine Blueprint of Creation. The East/West arch is Completion and Beginnings, the 1st and 2nd dimensions on which all other follow. The North/South arch is future and past. The Horizontal ring is the inter-dimensional presence.

The phone has a mirror with lipstick kisses on it, instructions on how to operate, and a book and pen for writing personal notes. The art piece has a real glass neon sign on top reading TALK DIRTY TO ME which provides a beautiful glow to the piece at night. The installation is fully solar powered.",

The slightest change in perspective creates an evolution in form, which will be seen from great distances, especially at night.  The three layers create valleys that participants can walk through, shifting focus from layers to an internal landscape.  Motion sensors set at the ends, and in other locations, will act as gateways, activating waves of complimentary colors through the more stable slow evolution of color in fiber optic systems lining every vertical element.  The work is meant to reflect on the complexity of layering energy and relationships, which shifts with only the slightest change",

The cutouts will be backlit, so they will shine through at night, lighting the entire structure. There will be a pin-spotlight shining straight up, out of the top of the structure. The Obelisk will also contain a door, leading to a soft and plush interior where people can find solace. The inside will be softly lit with EL Wire and fully upholstered with shaggy, faux fur.",

The case is propped on glowing rocks. Seven glowing rocks circle the coffin. This sculpture enchants and draws people to the mystical space it creates. Emotionally, this sculpture evokes fairytales and that the romantic and eternal sleep of the figure is outside of time and reality. The classical nature of the greek style statue contrasts dramatically with the barren and expansive character of the playa. Light drives the event at night, and every aspect of this piece will be illuminated bringing a soft white light to an otherwise very dark place.",

The Seed of Life is a universal symbol of creation. Found at the heart of an ancient symbol called the Flower of Life, there is an entire cosmology of consciousness encoded into this singular geometric seed. In essence, the Seed of Life symbol, with its seven interconnected circles, symbolizes the interconnection of life on Earth and universal existence. It also symbolizes that all life originated from a single source in a divine plan. The name, \"Genesis\" quite literally means - an origin, creation, or beginning.",

This piece is designed in layers, with the raging fire being the most readily visible, the thing that all will be seen from a distance.  For those that look closer, the woman will appear within the flames, and for those that look even deeper, it will become apparent that as the noise of the playa increases, so does the intensity of the fire, but the woman, she remains at peace.  Reminding us, that as the world burns, we remain in control of our reactions to it.",

Standing as a symbol of unity, the Face bridges: East & West, spiritual & biological, aquatic & terrestrial, fauna & flora. \n\nAquatic creatures constitute the elements forging the parallax illusion of a genderless portrait collage. Ambient music, sounds of nature, & multilingual echoes of Rumi's call, seduce wandering souls in BRC with a multisensorial composition that awakens the mind.\n\nThe Face beckons to all and guides without advice. The target is meditative dialogue. The process is intentional & incremental: one step at a time, one visitor after the other.",

Radical inclusion is not poorly defined gender stereotypes and artificial visions that upset the moral arc of the universe bending towards realistic body shapes and non-binary gender roles. Barbie is a plastic aesthetic that degrades the Burning Man culture with a false identity and unrealistic proportions.\n\nIf we love ourselves, honor those that create love and not what defines eating disorders. If we must pretend to be others, at least let it be a revolutionary countercultural visionary.\n\nThen, like all great Burning Man art pieces, climb inside, learn about Larry, take a selfie and depart for other shiny sparkly things.",

This work is an ambisonic sound installation (14.7 system)  creating a 3-dimensional, 360-degree sound field that fully immerses the listener. We gather compositions from different artists written for the sonic landscape of Catharsis, a geometric structure that is a physical manifestation of a hyperbolic space. Antematter adds a dimension to the structure, as the space is explored by the ears, if not also with the eyes.",

This is a communication method that uses clear text communication with a corresponding and mutable secret key - which is almost unbreakable without physical interception of the key. This was more common in the pre-Internet era - and short wave radio sets could easily tune into the stations, which would repeat in loops at night when the signal would propagate farther.  \n\nWhat messages will you hear?",

Adorned with 3,600 LEDs, this eclectic piece incorporates vibrant acrylic and bright sheet metal with recycled armor plate and reclaimed agricultural pipe. Its 8 elongated petals mechanically pivot overhead atop an 8' steel column like a compass rose. Its foliage naturally diffuses sunlight through 160 panels of chromatic lucite by day while a gradient of colors illuminate outward by night. From the shadow play of crisp silhouettes, to its prismatic light show, Fleur de LUX is visually stunning at any hour.",

It is said that in the universe in which we live is none other than Brahma, who creates the world through his dream, manifesting himself through the minds of mankind. The property of the consciousness of the god is to create reality through thought, as a passive observer of existence. The installation is meant to create a surreal and somnambulistic atmosphere of communication, a place where people meet.",

        "description": "Burners step back into the magic of their childhood when they look into for the first time to the viewport of an oversized kaleidoscope, where they transport to a magical world of magnificent swirling colors and fractal shapes. Brocken Sprectre immerses participants to become part of kaleidoscopic experience. On one end they look through to see the combinations of colors of the world in new ways.  On the other end of the scope they can become part of the colors of the world as they jump, play and make faces into the tube.  At night, well lit burners will be reflected and refracted on the shiny surfaces, inspirations for seeing the world in a new light.",

The artist said the vision of the piece was the strongest he had ever had. It is a symbolic representation of the tools that are needed to rebuild Paradise, CA, and the surrounding area that was also devastated by the fire.",

This causes the molecules to repeat into a large structure. however the result is not just a neat cube over a neat cube. The crystals jut out at 45 degrees, in an almost anti-gravity fashion. They can balance on the point because of tensegrity, as the stress of the structure is equally distributed to all of its points. When a person interacts with the sculpture, either by crawling inside during the day or playing with the shadow and light at night, they will be come a part of the geometry themselves, seeing the shadows reflecting on their skin and the land around them",

Here, our individual reflections in each 'facet' of the multitude of lens-like convex mirror are framed with everyone else' into a mosaic portrait of shared reflection, pointing us to the stars, literally and symbolically",

It's body is textured with scales made out of polished steel. Internal light emits from parts of the dragon as well as the top dome form which rests as a crown on the head of the human effigy. The internal light can be manipulated through hidden buttons, such as serpentine scales, on the entire sculpture. The different buttons can influence each other and produce novel light sequences.",

As you approach this intriguing and mysterious building with its unusually shaped galleries, appearing part machine, part creature, part abstract and surrealistic form. Its dynamic shapes appear otherworldly yet grounded. It is waiting for you to approach and become a part of it. This Museum encourages participants to enter through its Gifting Shop, where you will be encouraged to make a gift before entering. The building guides you along, as a partially covered hallway leads you to galleries on either side, until you have spent time in all eight galleries. When participants exit, they find themselves on a stage, the Theatre of the Participant.",

It's also re-programmable, so people can make their own composition. It encourages scribing, so people can share prose, lyrics and dreams from and for the inside the drum. And its designs reflect the dreams of the many people and cultures contributing from around the world.",

There is way too much carbon in the air, carbon released by the burning of fossil fuels that has been stored in the ground for millennia. When the sun hits these molecules they vibrate, creating energy that is warming up the planet. The logical solution would be to slash carbon emissions, and focus all our energy on healing ecosystems to bring down carbon levels in the air. However, the data shows that the richest 10% of the planet account for 52% of emissions, and the richest 1% emit more than double the emissions of the poorest half of humanity. It's time for radical honesty.",

The direction of the beam is aimed by volunteer \"Beamers\".  \n\nThe Art occurs  when Observers see the light and there is a Beamer aiming the beam to the Observer.

The open air, jungle gym-like skeleton invites multiple burners to simultaneously climb and walk through the sculpture. The entrance to the piece begins at 20' tall, with the gates consistently contracting to 4' at the center, before again expanding outwards to 20'. The open concept will trace striking geometric shadows across the playa floor during the day. At night LED strips, running lengthwise, display intricate animations that accentuate the contraction and expansion of the gates. These LEDs will be both sound and motion reactive, changing their behavior based on the presence of burners or art cars.",

This can be traced back to the 19th century, when revolutionaries first used it against the European monarchies. It was later adopted by Europe's anti-fascist movement. In the 1960's, most famously through Tommy Smith and John Carlos at the Mexico City Olympics, it became both an iconic symbol of the Black Power Movement and a universal representation of the struggle for civil and human rights. The image symbolizes the ongoing racism and injustice throughout the world, but it is also a beacon of power, pride and perseverance \u2013 holding the promise of 'Hope'.",

We have the opportunity to witness our projections. We question illusions. Optical Orb gives us a chance to see many faces at once, reflecting back at one another. Contained in this infinite kaleidoscope, we can observe our diversity and unity. What we see around us is a reflection of ourselves.",

The trees are to be arranged on a square grid, 10 trees by 10 trees, placed in concentrically smaller grids and culminating in an open area at the center. The forest will be bathed in dancing LED lights of multitude of colors shining through the shaped cutouts in the trees.   Citizens of Black Rock Desert will be able to see the forest for miles.   My hope is the forest will be placed in deep playa past the temple so it will be dark enough for the forest to shine.  Our hope is for participants will interact with the forest in the most magical way.   As one will enter the forest, the will find a world of colorful beauty where one can let go, dance, be silly, discover a new more playful self.   As an installation artist my goal is to create art that is experiential.  With the Forest, participants not only physically walk through and explore the piece, they get lost in the space and become one with the forest.",

After we construct the individual triangles, we'll coat the surfaces with a resin\u2011paint mixture to get the marble affect. \n\nThe cube is made of aluminum truss skinned with laser cut aluminum and backlit with LEDs.\n\nThey pyramid will also be constructed of truss and skinned with aluminum panels and will be climbable. The cube and merkabah will not be climbable.\n\nAt full height, the project will be 42ft tall and 27ft wide on it's point.",

An opening allows participants to enter inside of the sculpture to discover a wondrous grotto with shimmering golden walls and ledges to sit upon. A magnificent geometric light in the shape of the pineal gland hangs from the center of the head illuminating the sculpture at night. A large open book of empty lined paper with pens invites participants to record their dreams and reflect on their thoughts. Seed of Dreams provides a place for participants to seek refuge, meditate, or connect with their intuition.",

The enclosed, intimate moments absorb and play with sound, while also providing a refuge amongst the happenings of the 7:30 Plaza.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is at the heart of this project's material selection. The structural beams are made of repurposed trampoline parts with woven fabric tubing stuffed with straw, a material that will be returned back to the land within the artist's local community after use.  \n\nThe use of weaving in this art installation can elicit a sense of familiarity and belonging, while we return to nature, our bodies, senses and each other.",

This smiling six-limbed goddess with compound eyes, delicate antennae, and silky metal leg fringe, anal gills, and cercus is a warrior insect from another dimension. Her inquisitive antennae and six limbs swimmingly stir the air, simultaneously producing music: deep gongs and chimes as people, small below the huge stonefly, pull ropes at the base of the structure. The small action below causing large action above reminds us of the importance of small things.",

There is a recording device 5 feet high on the lamp pole where burners can interact with the art work by recording snarky comments into the audio system to be played back when the next burner triggers the motion sensor. Overall, the concept of the piece invites burners to interact directly with an artwork, using the visual/audio impact of well lit colorful streetlight to share the long tradition of burner snark.",

We have long associated with the participant WiFi network and will hopefully be able to provide WiFi again so artists can check in back home when they arrive.  By moving coffee production to our \"Ghost Kitchen\" back in the BLD we will be able to devote all the shade for the purpose of relaxation.

        "description": "DIPTOWN is a sprawling landscape installation of a town buried in sand with only building roofs sticking out of the ground.  Diptown was once a simply a local tourist trap situated in a dip. Something covered the town up to the roofline, and the dip was transformed into flat desert. What's happend? Here we leave space for interpretation. Everyone can invent their own legend. We only present an image, and we invite people to give it meaning and stories.\n\nMost of Diptown is hidden beneath the surface, in both the physical and metaphorical senses. Like an iceberg, it projects only a few feet above the surface. It will be up to imagine what else exists below the surface. It will up to viewers to fill in the rest of the details.",

Whereas we believe in facts, as a bonus, if you graduate our 16 year program with honors, you will earn the power to transmigrate.

The ground level viewing pool provides a live aerial vantage point of the playa when the weather is calm as well as various prerecorded ground looking videos when the weather is feisty. Participants will have a chance to glimpse the playa from a vantage point that few have seen before and will walk away with an additional perspective that can only be gained from above. This piece is about experiencing new perspectives together in the hopes of realizing how perspective, which is to say our experiences, shapes our day to day understanding of the world around us.",

It is a model of an idea, a reflection of half-seen and implied mathematical symmetries. It is an object of focus in a vast expanse, meant to bring people, separate or together, into a nexus of time and space. The Now. A place to confront existential dread with an appeal to the immediacy of the moment, a view of a horizon toward the future, and a reckoning and reflection of the past. Hard questions may arise. But so too, wonder and awe, and maybe understanding and hope. In this moment we can ask ourselves, What's The Point ?",

The height of the musical elements vary based on the tone of the notes that it creates.  Each one spins in the wind or by human activation and has an electro-mechanical assembly within that resonates three metal bar chimes that are tuned to produce a three-note harmonic chord.  The elements are designed to cause a warbling sound as they spin, which is referred to, in musical terms, as a Tremolo.  At night, self-contained lights will keep the sculptures lit for safety and the intensity will also increase and decrease based on wind speed.",

If you don't want to work out, have a sit in the comfy chair after choosing a comfort blankie from the comfy chest. All book boxes are active library exchange zones. There is a crucial need to bring mental & physical awareness to literature, free speech, and the censorship used to restrict access to information. Books make us better as a society.

It is called the Resurrection of the Clothes Peg and is an ode the resurgence of the female voice. The monumental form of an ordinary household item like a wooden peg is meant to evoke a sense of criticality questioning why such a rudimentary form is given such importance. There is a clear dichotomy of male and female energies as the form is heavy and solid and erect - almost phallic, yet the message is about feminine strength. The item represented is a reference to female domestic chores and its function of holding and supporting.",
