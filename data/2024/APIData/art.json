The crystalline structures, dynamically hued, mimic desert strength and fragility; reflecting back to utilize those qualities within ourselves. The installation radiates a kaleidoscopic glow, symbolizing hope and resilience with interchanging colors. Beyond aesthetics, it resonates as a plea for water conservation, prompting reflection on responsible usage. Interactive sound and light pieces inspire a collective journey toward environmental mindfulness. Rainbow Desert Waters invites exploration, with its interplay of colors, echoing the call for conservation within the fragile beauty of the desert landscape.",

The installation illuminates at night and is adorned by two signs reading \"Not Yours\" and \"Not Mine.\" It's a reminder that the fault was here before us and it'll be here after us; just because we stumbled upon it doesn't mean that others couldn't have. It's not about passing the buck, but owning, accepting, growing, and moving on from it. It's easy to cling to something unhelpful, creating an inability to grow, feeling paralyzed on the fault, shaming and blaming. Hopefully, TFLM reminds us to forgive with empathy and understanding, helping us all realize the faults do not define us, but how we handle them does, and that we can grow from them.",

Approaching, you find stunning, beautifully realistic Saguaro, Ocotillo, Organ Pipe, Joshua Tree, Prickly Pear, and Barrel cacti in a circle around a massive swinging platform. Swings, benches, and posts make an octagon shape with light \"stars\" hanging above. Surfaces of the swings, benches, and posts have sun, moon, star, and deity cut-outs with lights inside. You rest and interact with other Burners; at first sitting by yourself on the benches revitalizing your soul, then lounging on the swings intermingling with all. Laying on the large swing with Burners, all the stars above and lights shining through the metal cut-outs is magical and you feel at peace!",

It's something that we as a species have been unexplainably fascinated with. Perhaps there is something to gathering around and watching a tumbling dryer that pulls on our primal instincts in the same way a camp fire would. Maybe there is something more to this seemingly mundane machine.  \r\n\r\nDid you know: there has been documentation recently uncovered depicting what could be \"dryers with windows\" in ancient societies? Where did they come from? Was it an invention \"ahead of its time\" or was it...a gift from the gods?",

He has steam rising around and through him. This steam is coming from a crack in the playa caused from geothermal activity deep below the surface. \r\n\r\nConey has been built on top of this geothermal activity to project the citizens of Black Rock City from falling into the cavity and and being injured or burnt. Coney is a symbol of safety and protection, an image we all very familiar with in our day to day lives...traffic cones are everywhere...",

In 2016, we added another dimension \u2013 each gate was illuminated with a string of LEDs, allowing for complex patterns representing different frequencies.\r\n\r\nWith this new piece, audio waves can truly reshape the space itself.

HEARTH encourages a shift in perspective from the individual human experience to a broader, collective and planetary viewpoint. In essence, the philosophy of HEARTH is to use ART as a vehicle to explore the nature of individual and collective human existence and its intricate relationship with the planet, acknowledging the ambiguity and tensions that arise as we grapple with these complex emotions and challenges.",

Join the 2024 collective psyche of Burning Man by finding the time capsule, writing yourself a note on a pre-stamped postcard, and dropping it inside. The time capsule will be sealed on Sunday at 5pm before the Temple burn. In ten years, join us in the same place, at the same time to open it together. If you can't be there, your postcard will be mailed from Black Rock City, aiming to find its way back to you. Join us in this fun journey of self-reflection and shared dreams.",

The ship belongs to an adventuress, who travels the world in search of knowledge, treasure, and botanical curiosities. She ferries cargo to distant ports to fund her travels. But something has gone wrong! The ship is sinking, and looming above is a giant sea serpent, looking intently for someone or something. His name is Naga, a treasure-protecting serpent, sworn to guard something that was on the ship. Did he sink it? Or is he there to help? What will we learn about the enigmatic captain from her quarters? What stories will be told around the fires? What will we discover in the treasure chests, floating into the waves?",

Crafted meticulously from a diverse array of butterfly species, this sculpture tells a profound story of liberation, metamorphosis, and the boundless potential inherent in all. Interspersed subtly in the bottom portion of the sculpture will be various mixed-metal treasures. The dynamic interplay between the female figure and the butterflies illustrates the symbiotic relationship between personal growth, transformation, and the liberation of one's spirit.

Gaia is crying tears of sadness which fall from her face sizzling upon the globe on impact. The front of the base has a monitor showing a looped video clip showing the current destruction happening in our world on a daily basis. Gaia is looking out on a group of stumps left over from a forest being clear cut, created out of Hempcrete; the tree stumps give those watching the clip a place to sit and reflect. The art piece will use recycled materials whenever possible and will generate its own power supply using solar and wind turbine energy. Materials include steel, copper, brass, bronze, and gold as elements of the earth.",

Even though the sails don't capture air and blow in the wind, should the conditions be right, when the desert floor radiates heat and the shimmering illusion of water presents itself as a mirage, it becomes \"schooner\" like.

It is a creative and inspiring space to practice ritual, hang out and spend time to reflect upon (pun intended).  The Bridge between Heaven and Earth project gives opportunity to experience a reinterpretation of an ancient ritual practice of communication and interaction between two worlds. And to realize that life and death cannot be one without the other, that maybe death is not the end, but maybe just another beginning.",

Each piece windgineered to produce no MOOP! Your ride along the fence will be more fun than a barrel of playa chickens. More fun than Eggs Bar - well a close second. But you will definitely be smiling and enjoy the efforts of  many different artists. And of course the usual yard sale and thrift store gems given a new life in the sun wind and dust (maybe a bit of rain too).  Art 20 at the trash fence - It's not just for breakfast any more!",

For they know that true power lies not in uniformity, but in embracing the beauty of diversity.",

The piece will be approximately 18 ft long, composed of one pentagon followed by three hexagons supported by a matrix of charred timber framing work representing the carbon molecular structure. Love Shines Down is playful and approachable but provides a deeper look at a journey of discovery and new perspectives, breaking down barriers and promoting inclusion and tolerance. We hope this molecule brings smiles to faces and curiosity to minds. All interpretations are welcome, as embracing different perspectives encourages richer dialogue and connection to the piece and within the community.",

It serves as a metaphor for the portal to higher understanding, reflecting a collective journey towards love and enlightenment. Amidst the desert, it is a sanctuary for self-reflection, challenging viewers to contemplate their inner selves and the collective consciousness. The project merges art and philosophy, beckoning silent introspection about the role of love in transcending the ego and achieving unity.",

        "description": "The philosophy of The Tempest has its roots in a Shakespearian play that is based on these three principles: freedom, empathy and forgiveness, and nature versus nurture. The classical sculptural representation of Zeus/Neptune atop a storm cloud is mixed with contemporary elements such as aluminum lightning bolts combined with an interactive sound and visual system designed to give the viewer a full immersive experience of a thunderstorm. As in our childhood, a coming thunderstorm evokes a sense of wonder, power, and fear - not the kind of fear that is malicious, but the kind that is natural with its righteous place in our lives and hearts.",

The tear drop in the middle, drops and creates waves; one single tear in a vast ocean of choices and repercussions.\r\n\r\nWhich leads us to the 2024 installation, Ocean of Tears. As the ripples become waves in a vast ocean, we can sometimes find ourselves on tumultuous waters.\r\n\r\nAs the metal crank turns the illuminated plexiglass waves, mounted on a wood frame, we discover how the motions will impact the wave going back and forth through eternity. Regardless of the direction and path we choose, it will always create cause and effect. \r\n\r\nBy night, the ocean will be illuminated by colorful LEDs, in turn illuminating the surroundings and the impactful waves of our decisions.",

The cocoon also hides a steel helix-shaped sculpture that will be revealed during our OF1 burn.

It's All Salt highlights the absurdity and beauty of the brain, a complex system that can be both incredibly sensitive and resilient.",

At its center sits the pyramid, symbolizing self, stability, and enlightenment. Within it resides the essence of the individual.\n\nFloating within and beyond the pyramid are spheres, representing the myriad thoughts and perspectives in our minds. Initially contained within, these spheres extend outward, illustrating the interconnectedness of our inner and outer worlds. This underscores the artwork's core message: by exploring our inner selves through practices like meditation, we refine perceptions and influence the world.",

        "description": "VorteX SoulCatcher is a mystical sculpture inspired by aIndigenous dreamcatcher and made from driftwood collected from the shores of California and the banks of the Yellow Stone River. This artwork symbolizes the connections between life, memories, and dreams. Visitors are invited to sit and reflect, using the space to meditate and connect with the unseen. VorteX also serves as a sacred space for ceremonies, making it a living tribute to shared memories and cultural appreciation. With a serene presence, one can feel the whispers of the departed and the echoes of our past lives: the space for silent conversations that happen beyond the veil of our everyday existence.",

By navigating the labyrinth, participants encounter a series of paintings that challenge their grasp of reality, preparing them for the introspective climax. The central art object, illuminated to cast enduring shadows, symbolizes the transient yet impactful nature of existence. These shadows, living multiple lifetimes during the festival, embody wisdom and maturity, contrasting sharply with the fleeting nature of our daily experiences.",

The intricately carved etchings on the obelisk's wooden panels depict celestial and earthly motifs. \r\n\r\nBy day, the obelisk is a striking silhouette against the desert backdrop, a reminder of our unique place within time and space. As night falls, the installation glows from within, symbolizing enlightenment.\r\n\r\nMarked by geometric harmony it encourages one to consider their journey, to recognize their unique contributions to our collective story. It is a place to gather thoughts, to breathe deeply, and to feel grounded in the wide expanse of our existence. We all live, and we all pass away. What is your purpose?",

It is also a reminder of what we can create when we reuse and repurpose; and in doing so, save the places we love that are being inundated with our waste, overconsumption, and pollution. At Burning Man it's a place of rest, to meet, make friends, and be children again.",

Using a Very Low Frequency (VLF) receiver, participants can listen to the crackles and pops of lightning strikes from around the globe, sparking a sense of awe at the unseen electrical activity of our planet. The installation features a VLF receiver, speaker system, headphones, informational panels explaining the science, a shade structure, and seating; all set within the vastness of the open playa to optimize reception. This artistic exploration stems from the artists' fascination with the natural world and their desire to share this wonder with others, fostering a deeper appreciation for the unseen forces that connect us all.",

Trained on a corpus of content relevant to the Burning Man experience, some may experience it as an oracle of wisdom, others a Dadaist seer, and others a psychedelic visionary. It reminds citizens to choose their words carefully, not take themselves so seriously, hold healthy skepticism of technology, and most of all, embrace fun and frivolity on the journey of life. No, YOU'RE Hallucinating offers shelter, community, and 24/7 entertainment on the playa whether the visit is intentional or fortuitous.",

Each photograph is accompanied by an audio description, recorded by the artists, so the art works can be experienced through visual and non-visual means.",

This can be traced back to the 19th century, when revolutionaries first used it against the European monarchies. It was later adopted by Europe's anti-fascist movement. In the 1960s, most famously through Tommy Smith and John Carlos at the Mexico City Olympics, it became both an iconic symbol of the Black Power Movement and a universal representation of the struggle for civil and human rights. The image symbolises the ongoing racism and injustice throughout the world, but it is also a beacon of power, pride, and perseverance \u2013 holding the promise of 'Hope'.",

How is it relevant?  What would you request of it? Father Time stands on the pinwheel clock with a commanding presence. Its pillar adorned with watch faces in tribute of those loved ones whose time has come to pass.\r\nThe tall clock moves us fast as the wind blows, spinning the colorful pinwheel as it changes time with each rotation. Slowing us down, and then stopping time when in a place of peace. \r\nThe \u201creal time\u201d clock ticks, and turns, as it marches to time that is steadfast. Carrying us through life so we can connect in \u201creal time.\u201d\r\nThen there is flying time, blurring its\u2019 colors and blinding us to the present moment as we become lost in our pursuit to slow it down.\r\nAs a tribute to those who have gone before us, what\u2019s to determine a life well lived or lost too soon? By the time lived, or by the amount of life lived? \r\nRotations of time will travel around the west coast with the support of volunteers, honorably ending near the Temple.\r\n\r\n*If you, or someone you know, would like to include a watch face of a loved one who has passed, send this artist an email for a mailing address before 8/15/24 or leave it on the structure and it will be respectfully included.",

Three hand-painted silk flags stand tall at the trash fence with intricate gold and colourful lines, saying \"The universe is smiling at you\", \"The world loves you\" and \"You are beautiful\". These flags seek to remind participants that through small moments of joy like this, through kind strangers we meet, the universe is showing us, even in the hardest moments, that the universe loves us! At the journaling table, there is a journal with a pen attached, inviting BRC citizens to reflect on their moments of joy and love from the universe even during their toughest times. Journaling can bring joy, light, kindness and help stop anxious thoughts. Once participants are finished with journaling, they are encouraged to find the hint to the code of the safe and take a sticker or a patch gift with one of the phrases - one for themselves and one to gift to a stranger on or off Playa, spreading the ripples of kindness and joy even further.",

This installation mirrors the unforeseen rain on last year's playa, serving as a metaphor for the tears shed for those lost in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and past injustices. It's an interactive canvas that invites Black Rock City citizens to contemplate and discuss the true value of a life, beyond the dehumanizing toll of war and historical catastrophes. Our hope is to inspire a deeper collective awareness of life's immeasurable value in a world too often preoccupied with quantifying the invaluable.",

While Aeolian harps have been done before at Burning Man, the scale of this piece,  overall design, and other wind-driven components sets it apart from past efforts.  We hope that this piece provokes curiosity in your mind from the sounds it produces, perhaps even giving you some time to block out the noise and settle in with something that is driven by nature and not the kick of the bass.",

His efforts fail, ultimately he loses his tenuous hold on reality, and the story ends in despair and separation from society and the world. \r\n\r\nThe photos have quotes from literature thematically, but not directly related to the corresponding photo.  His descent is witnessed by the hurdy gurdy man (the Leiermann), who symbolizes aloneness, social marginalization, and madness. The musical instrument will be available to try.",

Our cute little robot artist, Mira, wants to talk about it. She yearns to fit in, become part of the culture, and earn acceptance. But can she do that without losing herself?\n\nMira is smart and interactive, creating art inspired by those she meets. Like a foreigner in a new land, she strives for acceptance while preserving her identity. By paralleling Mira's quest with our own, we aim to provoke conversations about radical inclusion, identity, diversity, and the balance between individuality and assimilation. Through this interactive piece, we highlight the shared experiences that unite us all.",

        "description": "The banana is used online as a universal measuring stick, to provide a concept of scale when photographing objects. Banana for Scale plays with the disorienting size and contrasting visual cues of Black Rock Desert, by placing a massive inflatable banana on the playa. This enormous banana offers little to no real visual information, and that's the point!\r\n\r\nBanana for Scale celebrates the importance of silliness in our lives and work as artists. It also highlights one of the unique challenges of making art for Burning Man: everything looks small in the expanse of the desert. This piece intentionally pokes fun at the conundrum of perspective on the playa, as well as the seemingly arbitrary choice of using a banana to demonstrate scale.",

It is surrounded by light bulbs, with a structure and netting that allude to a portal, blurring the boundaries not only in space and time, but also between science, art, reality, and fantasy. Above, there lies the heart of the dino, crafted from natural fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe Heartless Dino serves as an opportunity to transmute, through art, the atrocities implicit in environments of violence, while prompting reflection on the importance of intention and collective action in transforming reality. This collective action stems from a limitless imagination, celebrating fantasy, love, wonder, and curiosity.",

This artwork illustrates the death of one clock, which results in the death of all clocks and therefore Time itself. It does so in a whimsical manner designed to disturb but entertain at the same time. This 22-foot tall, climbable, surreal, collapsing clock has been pierced by a gigantic sword, its mechanism is broken and exposed, its numerals and hands distorted, and it has a giant Teacup and Saucer perched precariously at the top. The Teacup can accommodate 6 people at a time sitting on a circular bench in a surprisingly intimate setting. A huge, mysterious key hangs inside the clock but what is it for?",

While a tear gas canister is symbolic of war, the powerful and gentle flower counteracts it as a visual metaphor for hope for peace, creation from destruction, life from death, and hope, hope, hope. After a volcanic eruption destroys the land, fauna grows from the blackened soil. The flower symbolizes forgiveness in the place of retribution-- instead of tit-for-tat, hitting back when hit, the flower visually symbolizes that the first step to any kind of reconciliation in a fight is some kind of understanding of the other. There's a long tradition of the power of flowers as a peaceful symbol of resistance, from the sixties to now, and in line with that tradition, this sculpture hopes to be a bright and powerful call for peace in a time fraught with war.",

When the head is turned on its axis, the sound changes, like when you are searching for a certain frequency on a radio tuner. As you turn the heads toward the center of the circle, the sound becomes a clear note. Similarly, the color of the light inside the head changes and becomes brighter.\r\n\r\nOnce the heads are all facing each other, a burst of light arises, as well as a magnificent chord composed by the respective notes of each head.",

Symbolizing resilience and grandeur, the throne features large geometric shapes, seamlessly blending past with future aesthetics. Its towering backrest evokes ancestral connection and celestial grace, while its warm golden hue adds a regal touch to the piece's allure. As an interactive work, it prompts contemplation on traditional societal power dynamics. It challenges us to examine who is entitled to occupy positions of power, which typically excludes individuals from marginalized communities. This throne represents a reclaiming of that power, disrupting the notion of eligibility when considering access, and status. This sculpture invites individuals from all walks of life to take a seat on the throne with the goal of contributing to a regenerative future of inclusivity and empowerment.",

This art piece commemorates the euphoric feelings of self-discovery, gratitude, and freedom of expression that the Playa provides through the form of a deconstructed music box. \r\n\r\nThe music box is a 16' cylinder that slowly rotates, creating an enclosed secluded space where people can duck up into; inside they'll hear the sweet sounds of a custom music comb striking, transforming the entire room into a resonance box. In concert with the melody, this rotating disk will mechanically engage eight zoetropes through a geared system. Each zoetrope will feature an animation, evoking the magic of inspiration and gratitude for this shared experience together.",

This arrangement allows for 20 or more artworks to be experienced together as a group. Each art piece stands alone on open playa in a designated area, avoiding the challenges a small project might have if it were isolated. Decorative park lamps and ground lighting makes it easy to find the entire ensemble at night. Visitors are invited to spend some quality time with several pieces at once while having a seat on a park bench. The open layout of the park allows artists to present subtle themes that could be overlooked when compared to the larger art nearby.",

Further investigation reveals the building as a memorial though scattered items, projections and images.\r\n\r\nOccasional tea ceremonies, and other impromptu performances and recorded audio insertions will be programmed.\r\n\r\nAt night, through simple lighting and projections, the installation provides a delicate interplay of light, color and shadow.",

The artist has customized each element\u2014mailboxes, street lights, electrical resistors from power poles, and (non-functioning) CCTV camera housings\u2014in ways that will invite nature to take over, to repurpose these mundane things in a future that might need more bird nests, mason bee homes, or vegetation everywhere in our modern urban areas.\r\n\r\nWith steam-punk aspects and a soft aesthetic for the tower itself, Build Better Ruins asks us either how we might re-imagine the existing modern landscapes around us today or, perhaps, how nature might do that for us in some near future.",

Inside is a phone connected only to the wind, where you can talk to someone who can no longer hear you. We pay homage to the original Wind Phone in Japan that allowed survivors of the 2011 tsunami a place to say goodbye to missing loved ones.\r\n\r\nThe banners are dyed using melting ice and gravity blending the colors and creating beauty out of loss. This process is a reminder of the melting glaciers and sea ice caused by climate change. This loss, in turn, is tied to the Wind Phone, the intangible connection to our missed loved ones, and our global grieving for environmental loss.",

By harnessing the power to create rainbows like never before, a not-so-fleeting rainbow covers anything in its path, creating an unforgettable moment that stays with the person long after they leave the art installation. At night black lights create a captivating kaleidoscope effect through the same prismatic windows. The artist hopes to evoke feelings of child-like curiosity and playfulness to all.",

Participants can control the height of the light, making it an ever-evolving spectacle that beckons all to engage, climb, sit, and converse. When not under participant control, the light moves of its own accord as if by magic.",

Meditation cushions are arranged in a circle around the trunk, providing a space for reflection.

Through a wormhole in its stem, citizens can enter inside of the mushroom, which is made of a metal that is polished to act as a mirror, allowing participants to explore the weirdness and depth of their inner worlds. Whimsical artistic lights dancing within the mushroom and lasers outside of it transform its surrounding into a magical world.

It draws inspiration from Dia de Los Muertos, the Catholic church, and colonialism. It includes an upside down cross in the archway. It acknowledges the history of colonization and its negative impact on the global community. OS No. 4 challenges the status quo and makes an argument that we don't need to subscribe to dogmatic belief systems to accept each other. The piece uses historical and cultural references to remind people how beautiful we can be if we base our behavior from a place of love instead of greed or fear.",

The aluminum tubes span some 25 feet, but are surprisingly easy to climb.  Inside the ball you find a captains' station, controls, and screens, but nothing seems to be working.  You activate the initiation sequence, and <WHUMP> the machine, with a thump and a flash, comes alive! A video appears on the screen in front of you, and the controls are flashing, so you reach forward, and < eeeeeooooouuuuuuummmmmm>\r\n\r\nIs all of this a step towards a real time machine? Well, there's definitely been a clear progression through time\u2026",

Later, the monks developed a similar scenario with the fabled 108 worries and chimes to recognize them. The curious human mounts up on the seat, allowing things to become increasingly shaded.  The user does not hear sound only through their ears, instead, through every pore of the body, nostrils, eyes, each ear drum becomes permeated, intruded, the audible being experiences sound through their entire being. The chakra of a sound's particular influence on the user, one either slows or quickens the rhythm of the blood circulation. The awakening of the senses increases lung capacity, soothing the nerves...

Entering the structure yields cool shade and a view into a large round luminous oculus looking into a giant kaleidoscope. Placing one's face into the oculus -- actually inside the kaleidoscope -- makes reality drop away: infinitely reflected morphing video images synced to an ever-changing soundscape, all controlled and played by an inscrutable set of glowing knobs. Mind blown. Strange sounds and alien music hypnotically pulse to dripping, melting, glowing images, leading deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. Lose track of time and space, emerge into the night to see the outside of the prism lit by thousands of dancing, pulsing LEDs.",

Our robot, Atlas, no longer knows what signs are, what they are for, and is looking for input to make things that are meaningful and beautiful once again. \r\n\r\nParticipants see aspects of their own nature in the robot and the quintessential purpose of sign making (to which they are invited to contribute), including the search for direction, safety, belonging, understanding, and meaning.",

        "description": "Turns out, dancing is literally the best medicine. This piece responds to a recent peer-reviewed article studying the impact of different treatments for depression. The study (Noetel et. al 2024) found that, compared with active controls, large reductions in depression were found by simply dancing. In fact, dancing was the best thing you could do, leaving pharmaceutical interventions in the \"dust\".\n\nThis solar-powered LED micro-disco creates a space for the citizens of Black Rock to put these findings into practice. This installation uplifts the power of dance and provides space to experience the impact of spontaneous dance while providing the knowledge that dance will forever be a tool to shape one's experience in this world.",

As a singular focus, it becomes a powerful tool for expression, conveying emotions ranging from anger and frustration to empowerment and independence. The gesture can provoke, shock, or make bold statements about societal norms, authority, and individual agency. We invite viewers to contemplate its significance and the broader implications of resistance in art and society. In its linear isolation, the middle finger transcends its physical form to become a symbol of uncompromising dissent and unwavering self-expression.",

The park is laid out taking into account the 4 directions, centered around a freestanding fireplace of burning handwritten words that read \"I still love you\". Various mediums of Steele's signature signage surround the fireplace with a carefully curated selection of empowering messages on road signs and marquee boards. There is also a series of mirrored road signs with inspiring messages for endless self-reflection. The last piece of the puzzle is a \"Complains Box\" with neon, an interactive mode of expression and communication.",

At its heart, a suspended bell resonates with each passage under the arch. Illuminated by red light at night, it draws inspiration from Hindu Kali mythology. Participants get to shed their burdens and embrace renewal. Along the path, several metal bowls beckon. Participants can inscribe their burdens on stones before passing under the arch, accompanied by ritual sounds. A fire ritual, burning offerings on sheets, enriches the experience. Through these symbolic acts and immersive engagement, Invoke The Fiery becomes an invocation to change, urging passage and liberation from burden.",

Lyre '72 explores how our worlds are intricately woven together; that no matter the era, we can find commonality.\r\n\r\nLyre '72 is a series of seven wooden orbs that are each woven with thousands of feet of paracord. It was created as a memorial to the artist's mother, who recently passed from dementia and Alzheimer's. As is so often the case with these diseases, one begins to remember more about the past than to understand the present; so the artist wanted her memorial to focus on the idea of nostalgia but in a modern context.",
