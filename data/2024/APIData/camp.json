Imagine a summer camp created where RuPaul with Josephine Baker and Alexander McQueen as the head Camp Counselors. A summer camp where you can explore the realities of Burning Man by asking: how do we collectively construct our reality here?\n\nAt Camp Campy Camp, we celebrate everyone in their finest form. We pay homage to the LGBTQ+ BIPOC originators of drag and ballroom. Our goal is to create a space akin to what ball culture has done \u2013 a space where anyone can be themselves, a space to fully celebrate each person for who they are. \n\nOur offerings will include traditional camp activities with a twist (merit badges, friendship bracelets, knitting, ropes course). Stop by any afternoon Tu-Fri to see what we have on deck!",

When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection. This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows.

But fear not, because Whiskey and Dust Mutants will be there to support two mutant vehicles, Ma'am the Mammoth and Frederick the Nautilus, all while teaching the masses about good whiskey. \n\nSo, we got together with the Golden Guy Alley where we will be building a new bar. Look for the iconic Whiskey and Dust neon sign. But wait, there's more! You can find a Speakeasy in the Mutant Vehicle Support Camp. While the alley bar will be a little more focused on whiskey education and limited to six guests at a time, the Speakeasy is a good place to hang out during any moment of the day or night like in the Whiskey and Dust bar of yesterday.",

On the surface we are a tea camp, a clean airy oasis designed for comfort and connection. What draws people in isn't a carnival barker or a giant sound system. Instead, it's the unmistakable emotional appeal of genuine human warmth. Our camp is home to many experienced burners well schooled in the arts of quip and camp, but our offering to the city goes beyond the superficial. Ours is a camp for you to be seen and heard so the magic that moves us can flow, and the structures that bind and blind us can melt away. Let your truest self be freed to connect with others and be blown this way or that, all over a cup of tea.",
