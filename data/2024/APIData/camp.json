A wheelchair lift and Braille rails accommodate that many more Burners into the artcar experience.\n\nWe enjoy mass-gifting our fellow Burners with Deep Playa Beer Delivery (quenching the late afternoon thirst in the heat) and 'Smores (late nights in deep playa to ease the chill with warm gooey treats.) Each of those gatherings generates micro-community among those Burners brought together. Look for Fluffy!!",

In our main dome we will have DJs, musical acts, spoken word nights, movies under the stars, etc. The dome is decked out with foam flooring, mattresses, cushions, pillows, blankets and low top tables.  So one minute it can be our dancefloor and the next minute our lounge. Whatever the offering, we want people to feel like 1001 nights gives rest to weary souls desperate to recharge.

But fear not, because Whiskey and Dust Mutants will be there to support two mutant vehicles, Ma'am the Mammoth and Frederick the Nautilus, all while teaching the masses about good whiskey. \n\nSo, we got together with the Golden Guy Alley where we will be building a new bar. Look for the iconic Whiskey and Dust neon sign. But wait, there's more! You can find a Speakeasy in the Mutant Vehicle Support Camp. While the alley bar will be a little more focused on whiskey education and limited to six guests at a time, the Speakeasy is a good place to hang out during any moment of the day or night like in the Whiskey and Dust bar of yesterday.",

        "description": "Our camp is a playground for the free-spirited and a home base for nomads with a thirst for connection and adventure. We're a global tribe of dream-chasers and boundary-pushers, supporting each other to live our best lives; from the peaks of New Zealand to the shores of Thailand, and everywhere in between.  We are solid as a community and feel that the space we hold between us can inspire other Burners to live courageously and less conventionally, as we all aim to do, as a community together. Join us, where every moment is a chance to shake up the soul and sprinkle a little more magic into the burn.",

When the sun is just above the mountains, we toast the sunset and welcome the night. We play games with a mature and imaginative twist. As with all Juke Joints, cards, parlor games, and themed gatherings occur and conversation informal. In a world of hate speech and some loud shitty people, we bring love and unity.

We love the multifaceted variety of environments and believe that it makes Illumination Village a unique and delightful place to visit. \n\nCome take a steam during the day and make sure to visit our Fire Art Carnival in the evening.
